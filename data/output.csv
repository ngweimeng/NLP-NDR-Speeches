Friends and fellow Singaporeans, I've known Mr Goh Chok Tong for a very long time, more than 25 years.We first met in 1978. It was not long after he entered politics. We met socially and I remember he was explaining to me how he was consciously staying away from making speeches on shipping matters because he was from NOL (Neptune Orient Lines) and he wanted to broaden out and talk about other subjects. Soon after I met him, I went away to the US to study. When I was away, I needed to make a presentation on Singapore – Know Your World – and wanted something to show the Americans what Singapore was like. So, I asked Mr Goh and he sent me some slides of activities in Marine Parade, a kite-flying competition, something you won't find in America and it added something to letting the Americans know us. I came back from America after two years in the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces). He was my minister. I would brief him regularly. Then I entered Cabinet and he was a colleague and then, he was the Prime Minister.
When Mr Goh took over from Mr Lee Kuan Yew as PM, many people wondered how he would work out because Singapore had had onlyone PM ever since it was independent, in fact, ever since before it was independent. What would the new PM be like? Would he be his own man? What mark would he put on Singapore? All this uncertainty was soon dispelled. Chok Tong established his own style, milder, gentler, consultative and inclusive, but firm and clear. He built his own team. He retained key members from his own generation to help with the transition. He brought in new and younger ministers and he got good men and women to work with him and formed a strong team. And I'd just like to mention two of the people who kept on and stayed with him. One is Mr Dhanabalan, who had actually gone into the private sector after the transition was completed and came back in again when I was ill with lymphoma in 1992 and took over from me in MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) and looked after MTI for one year, one crucial year, and helped out at a very difficult time. And the other one is Dr Tony Tan, who also went out after the transition into the private sector, but came back in 1995 because Chok Tong asked him to help run Mindef (Ministry of Defence) for two years. And he stayed for nine years and now, he's staying for another year to help me out with my transition. So, I owe them a thank you.
Chok Tong launched new policies to take Singapore forward. Some were popular policies, like Edusave and Medifund. Everybody liked them. Some were difficult but necessary policies. We had to cut the CPF (Central Provident Fund), we had to raise the GST (Goods and Services Tax), not popular, but we had to do it and Chok Tong sold these policies and persuaded people to do it. Many things were in foreign policy. He travelled, he made friends with foreign leaders, he established contacts, gained their respect and made use of these links for our advantage, for example, establishing many free trade agreements with important trading partners and I should just mention one, the US free trade agreement because that one was born on a golf course. One evening after dinner, he persuaded Bill Clinton to play golf in Bandar Seri Begawan at night and over 18 holes, a free trade agreement was born. So, that means he's telling me I should play golf.
Chok Tong established his own connection with Singaporeans, not high-flown oratory, but sincere, direct, personal. He made people feel comfortable and listened to. He persuaded people to accept tough decisions. He explained highly-sensitive issues and defused them and so, when we had dialogues discussing very difficult things, I was always very comfortable sitting next to him because I knew that no matter how difficult the subject, how awkward the question, how uncomfortable the audience, he would be able, with a soft turn of word, with a joke, with a nice question back, to put the audience at ease and get his point across. And that's why when you see the pictures of me sitting next to him on a dialogue, I'm always smiling. But following him on the National Day Rally all by myself here, well, that's a different show altogether. But Chok Tong won the support of voters and the respect and the affection of Singaporeans and brought us all closer together as one people and, for that, I think we all thank Chok Tong.
I owe a personal debt to Goh Chok Tong. I didn't plan to enter politics or to become PM, but he brought me in. He guided me and supported me and especially over these last 14 years when I was his Deputy PM (DPM) and since coming in, politics has engaged all my energies and abilities. It's what they call a 24/7 job, there's no running away from it.
I've been part of a team dealing with many issues, big and small, and I've learnt much from the previous two PMs, especially not just to focus on policies but on how the policies impact people, the lives of individual Singaporeans, what does it mean, how does it hurt, where can we help. So, I've always paid a lot of attention to my MPS cases, my Meet-the-People Session cases. Nine out of 10 are routine, but always keep my eye open for that last tenth one where the policy has gone wrong, the implementation is not right or maybe the policy is wrong and has to be changed and we have to do something, intervene and put it right. I won't tell you which ones otherwise you will all come and look for me. But I have red stickers on my table so when such a case comes, I put a red sticker and I see to it personally. I've learnt that not all problems can be solved, but some can and must and when you do solve one of these, it really gives you a high and it gives my helpers a high too. It makes my evening worthwhile and then the next time you come back for the MPS, chuffed up, enthused, energised and we try again. And when you have a long case, well, we sit patiently and we wait.
It's a big step from being DPM to being PM. It's not just working out policies or managing the economy. It's really uniting all Singaporeans, making sure everybody knows and feels that we are on the same venture together and building our nation and making each generation of Singaporeans feel proud to be Singaporean, proud to carry that pink IC and that red passport wherever we go.
It's a unique challenge leading Singapore now, in 2004, because Singapore is at a crossroad. It's a different world out there. It's a post-Cold War world. What does that mean? It means there's one hyperpower, the United States. There's no two superpowers, it's not a multipolar world, it's one hyperpower. China is rising, India is opening up, Southeast Asia is also growing in transition, but reasonably optimistic overall. And one major reality out there is the war on terrorism which is going to continue for a long time to come.
In Singapore, this is not just a change of the PMs. It's a generational change to the post-independence generation. It's a different generation of Singaporeans, different from the group which fought for independence, different from the group who grew up with independence in the immediate post-independence years who experienced the transformation, saw how Singapore changed, saw the effort and the passion which went into building Singapore, which went into achieving what we have and wanted to pick up and run and carry on with the job. Now, it's a new generation and it's got to take Singapore another step forward, another level higher.
To do that, we need a fresh and bold approach. We've been successful, wildly successful. Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting here today. But we can't stand still because the world is changing, our people are changing and so must Singapore and so must the way we govern Singapore.
To succeed, we have to balance between continuity and change, keeping what is still working and good and strong in our system, which is a lot, and changing the part which is obsolete, discarding the part which is no longer relevant, inventing new pieces, new ideas to deal with new problems and to take advantage of new opportunities and to develop new strengths and strategies to thrive in a different world.
We can never afford to be satisfied with the status quo, even if we are still okay, even if our policies are still working. People say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". I say, if it ain't broke, better maintain it, lubricate it, inspect it, replace it, upgrade it, try something better and make it work better than before.
I was a member of Chok Tong's team and I contributed to many of Chok Tong's policies. These are sound policies, but we must always be prepared to look at them again, we must never be trapped by what we have and we must update them and conceive new ideas to go ahead. And this is true not just of the government but also of Singapore, also of society.
The Ministry of Education recently did a survey of CEOs and employers. They wanted to know how the employers looked at the output from our schools, looked at the young generation of people who are coming out from school, universities, working, what are their strengths and weaknesses. And they made many observations, but it boiled down basically to one key point which I think we know at the bottom of our hearts, sometimes we don't articulate it, and it is this – we are so capable, we are so efficient, we are so comfortable that we stick with what we have tried and tested and found working and we are reluctant to take risks and try new things. And that is a weakness. It's a weakness which we have to overcome.
The key to overcoming this is a mindset change. We have to see opportunities rather than challenges in new situations, we have to be less conventional, we must be prepared to venture and you've got to do this as individuals, we've got to do this as a government and I think we have to do it as a society. Let me give you some examples of what I mean. As individuals, let me give you a personal example because this is something which is true of all of us and me, too.
One day recently, I was coming back to Singapore Changi Airport, Arrival Hall, immigration counters. The security officer said, ""Walk through"". I said, ""No, let me queue up and see what it's like"". So, I came in. There are about eight counters, right? ""All Passports"", ""All Passports"", ""All Passports"", ""All Passports"". The last two say ""Singapore Passports Only"". What shall I do? The ""All Passports"" counters were all empty. The ""Singapore Passport"" counters had a long queue. So, I looked at this -- this doesn't make sense. Why is everybody doing that? They should go across. Then, I thought of it more, I thought maybe, they know something I don't. So, I joined them at the ""Singapore Passports"" counter. I stood there for 30 seconds. I said, ""This doesn't make sense"", went across, sailed through. The girls smiled at me, beamed, offered me a sweet. So, I think the pressure to conform, to go with what we're comfortable with -- he's doing it, let's do the same -- it happens to all of us. I think it's something we have to combat. Nobody is there, let's go there first, see what happens. So, that's on the individual level. I am sure you have examples, but I will just stick to myself today.
As a government, we have to rethink all our problems, big and small. Nothing should ever be set in stone. We've made big changes recently. The GST changes is a big one. The CPF cut was a big one and now, we are working on wage reform. That's another big one which will take some time and this will have a significant impact on our future. So, we've got to change our policies or look at our policies. We've got to support entrepreneurs. We've got to support Singaporeans being spontaneous, being unconventional. We should not put obstacles in their way. We should help them to succeed.
Let me give you one example. These are the Duck and Hippo Tours. You know what's a Duck Tour? It's a boat with wheels where you take a ride, you go into the harbour, you sail around, you come back. The Duck took two years to get a licence -- nearly died. Very difficult because they went to the LTA (Land Transport Authority). LTA says, ""Your duck has a propeller, how can it be a car?"" They went to the MPA (Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore). MPA says, ""Your duck has wheels!"" So, ding-dong, it took two years. Eventually, we sorted the problem. The Duck became a success. So, came the Hippo. The Hippo is a bus with no top, okay? So, you sit on top, you drive around. It's just like in London or one of the other Western cities. Question -- Is the Hippo a bus? A very important question because if it is not a bus, it is not allowed to stop at a bus-stop. So, that one we did better. Six months, we solved the problem. I think we have to do better than that.
We also need, as a government, to encourage participation and debate. We have opened up over the years. We've got the Speakers' Corner. We've allowed a lot more discussion. If you read the newspapers, what the newspapers write, the columnists, the Forum Page writers, the degree of debate is much more than we used to have, or in Parliament. But I think we can go further.
So, there are two things we are going to do. One, for indoor talks, we are going to do away with licensing. Right now, if you are going outdoors or indoors, if you want to do a talk, you need a Public Entertainment licence. Usually, it's approved, it's not a problem, but once in a while, you are slow or the police have reservations, they say, ""No"", but it's very rare. So now, we've decided we are going to exempt indoor talks from licensing requirements unless they touch on sensitive issues like race and religion.
The second thing we're going to do is to open up the Speakers' Corner where you can go and make any speech you like and we are going to say, ""Well, if you want to go there and have an exhibition, go ahead"". Once in a while, Think Centre says they want to go to the Speakers' Corner and they want to plant 100 flowers there, let the 100 flowers bloom. Well, I think go ahead. They want to water the flowers, go ahead. They want to turn the flowers down, go ahead. I mean, free expression as long as you don't get into race and religion and don't start a riot. It's a signal – speak, speak your voice, be heard, take responsibility for your views and opinions.
As a society also, we have to be forward-looking. I asked some young people what they would like me to say tonight and one of them said this – ""Be forward-looking. Don't let elders deter you by saying it cannot be done or scare you with war stories"". Maybe, I was telling him war stories because I know him. I agree that you shouldn't be scared by your elders, but I think you should listen to them, think carefully what their lessons mean in this new day and age and then use those lessons to avoid unnecessary mistakes and solve problems our way today. But we have to be prepared to accept the diversity of views and to listen to the debate and to have this discussion, always with a view to moving Singapore forward.
Let me give a controversial example. It's quite a controversial one. Some people told me, ""Don't raise it, it’s your first rally speech, very dangerous"", but I'm going to do it anyway. It's to do with the casino.
We've said, ""No'' to the casino for a very long time. I've said ""No"" to the casino for a very long time. In 1985, we had a recession. I remember the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan wanted the casino, argued for it. We said, ""No"". We didn't proceed. This time round, we had the ERC (Economic Review Committee). The Subcommittee has put up the proposal for a casino. On the ERC, I said, ""No"", a majority of the members said, ""No"". We didn't recommend it.
But the subject didn't die and we have to reconsider because the argument comes up, the situation changes.
Why is the situation different? Because there are ""cruises to nowhere"", more and more cruises to nowhere. Some don't even cruise, some anchor nowhere. You can go to Batam. I'm told there are 13 down there. I haven't been there, but Wong Kan Seng has been. He told me it was by accident, and Singaporeans go there. So, Singaporeans are already doing this, right?
Then you want tourists. There are millions of tourists because the Indians have money to spend, the Chinese have money to spend. Every tour group to Singapore goes to Genting. Macau is opening up. Now, they have broken the monopoly, new operators, more shows, more games.
If we want to grow our tourism traffic and double the number of tourists to Singapore, we don't just want them to come here because of gambling, but if gambling is one of the things they want to do, then maybe we should allow them to do that in Singapore, find some way to do that and if, as a result of that, I get, over 10 years, double the traffic volume, I think we should think about it.
So, MTI has come with a new proposal, not just a casino, but an integrated resort, entertainment centre. So, you have shows, you have family entertainment, you have food, restaurants, art, all sorts of things and in the middle, of course, you also have this place.
Should we say, ""No""? Well, I think we should take a deep breath and think about it carefully. I know many Singaporeans have expressed concerns and very strong concerns and the religious groups particularly have very strong views and their objections are not irrelevant. They are valid objections. It's because of these objections that for so long, we haven't done this. But I think we shouldn't just say, ""No"". I think we should consider -¬ can we have the casino and still contain the social problems? Let's study it. Let's see if there's some way to do it.
So, I think what we are going to do is to request for proposals. Let's put out to say we are going to impose the following restrictions: Singaporeans below a certain income, you don't go. I mean, if they want to travel all the way to Batam, that's them, but we will not make it easy for people to go broke and ruin their families in Singapore. But if a millionaire wants to bring another millionaire friend from China or India, I don't think I should say ""no"" to him. It may help lessen my other taxes. So, I think we will find a reasonable restriction, draw a line, call for the proposals, test the market. Let's see what proposals come in. If it makes sense and people think that this is worth doing commercially, we make a judgment, we proceed. If it's not worth it, not worth the downside risks, then we will call it off.
We will consider all views before deciding. Finally, if we decide against it, then I think we will have had a valuable debate in our society, a valuable discussion and sent a strong signal that we are prepared to discuss all sorts of things and reopen long-settled issues. But if we decide to proceed, then the final solution which we implement will have to address the valid concerns which Singaporeans have raised. So, it's not black and white. I mean, it's looking for an appropriate middle way where we can have our cake and also eat most of it.
Increasingly, the world is going to be like that. China opened up. Deng Xiaoping said, ""When you open the windows, the flies will fly in"". So, you can't close the windows, you'll just have to have a fly-swatter, a fly-trap, have one of these UV lights to zap them, but keep the windows open and keep your interior as clean and as hygienic for your own people as possible. And I think that's the attitude we should have.
So, with such a framework, with such an approach to our problems, what are our priorities? There are many, but tonight, I would like to list just five of them.
Firstly, external relations, making friends with other countries and protecting our interests overseas. Secondly, building the economy, creating jobs, helping wages and incomes to go up, pressing on with upgrading, looking after those who are affected by this. Thirdly, engaging the new generation. Fourthly, educating, investing in our young so that they are not just learning to make a living for themselves but also developing their character and their emotional roots in Singapore and discovering their strengths and achieving their potential; not just for a few, but for every child and also to get them to learn their mother tongues. And the fifth one, I put it last, but I'm sure you won't forget it, has to do with more babies. But let me start with external relations even though I think for many Singaporeans, the economy is at the top of your minds.
One thing which isn't going to change is our approach to external relations. We seek to be friends with all countries, and especially with our immediate neighbours and the major powers. We pursue win-win co-operation with all countries who are willing to co-operate with Singapore, but that doesn't mean that we can always accommodate the views or the positions of other countries. When our vital interests are at stake, we must quietly stand our ground. As Dr Habibie said, I'm sure you’ll remember, Singapore is a little red dot. If we don't defend our interests, who will? This approach has earned us respect internationally and a network of good relations with many countries around the world.From time to time, we are put to the test. As a small country, we can't afford to flinch. When Michael Fay was sentenced to caning for vandalism, Bill Clinton as President wrote to our President on his behalf. But we couldn't remit his sentence of caning. All we could do is to reduce two strokes. From six, we went to four. If this were a Chinese punishment, wu shi da ban (fifty floggings with the stick) would become si shi wu da ban (45 floggings). And people in Asia noted our stand. When PM Mahathir of Malaysia pressured us to change the water agreements, we stood firmly by our legal rights. We gave a full public explanation of the negotiations with Malaysia – why we were justified in international law and we were prepared to go to any international tribunal. But we still do our best to maintain good relations with the US and with Malaysia and, in fact, our relations with these two countries, I think, are good.
Our closest neighbours are Indonesia and Malaysia. They will always be of special importance to us. Indonesia is holding its second round of the presidential elections soon. Malaysia has a new PM. I've known PM Abdullah Badawi for many years already and under him, our relations have taken a fresh start and I look forward to working with PM Abdullah Badawi to strengthen our bilateral relations further. I was very grateful that after I was sworn in, the next day he gave me a call to congratulate me and to wish me well. So, I said I look forward to working with him.
We have broad relations with China for many years since the visit of Deng Xiaoping to Singapore – he was then the Vice-Premier – in 1978. And we want to deepen these relations for the future. Unfortunately, our ties with China are currently under some strain after the Chinese reaction to my recent visit to Taiwan.
I've seen letters to the press – Straits Times, also Zaobao, also Berita Harian – which show they understand the Government's position and I am grateful for the support they've shown the Government. But nevertheless, tonight, let me explain why I needed to visit Taiwan, why Singapore is not changing its one-China policy and why I've become more worried about the cross-straits situation after my visit.
Why did I visit Taiwan? Because the cross-straits situation is the most serious security problem in the region, the most dangerous problem. Economically, China and Taiwan are getting closer together. They say half-a-million Taiwanese work in China, but politically, the two are drifting apart. China has made it very clear that if Taiwan moves towards independence, China is not going to stand idly by and war may be inevitable.
In this current, very tense situation, I will have to make some very difficult judgment calls as PM. I wanted to understand the thinking of my friends and contacts in Taiwan. Some of them are now key leaders on both sides, on the Pan-Green side and on the Pan-Blue side. I needed to sense the shifts in the tone and texture of Taiwanese society. Only then can I make an objective assessment with conviction and knowledge. You've got to talk to people, feel them, sense their mood, their body language, the atmosphere in the society and I can't get this feel just by sitting in my office surfing the Internet, reading reports, even secret reports, or watching CNN or CNA. It’s not possible. You have to be there.
If other countries are going to take Singapore's views and assessments of the cross-straits situation seriously, then they've got to view us as informed, impartial and balanced. If Singapore can help in some way to prevent miscalculations by some key players, then we are going to do our utmost to do so. We are small, we are not influencing the events, but we can provide some inputs to help the key players avoid mistakes and misjudgments.
Why did I go in July? Because Chok Tong had told me that the handover would be in August and so, July was the only window for me to go before becoming PM.
The Chinese have protested that my visit to Taiwan was contrary to Singapore's one-China policy. But Singapore has always observed the one-China policy. We took this position right from our independence in 1965. In 1971, we voted for PRC's admission into the UN to take its UN seat. In October 1990, we established diplomatic relations with China. By then, China understood Singapore's position on Taiwan, that historically, we have unique and important interests there which continue to be vital to our security today.
Two years after we established diplomatic relations with China, I visited Taiwan in 1992. I was then already DPM. So, my recent visit toTaiwan is not my first one under these circumstances, it's my second one, and it doesn't contradict our one-China policy. Nor can it be seen as emboldening Taiwan independence elements. This makes no sense because the Taiwanese know too well that we stand for one China and are opposed to Taiwan independence. Indeed, we are very worried by the growth of Taiwan independence forces.
Singapore's one-China policy will not change. A move by Taiwan towards independence is neither in Singapore's interests nor in the region's interests. If Taiwan goes for independence, Singapore will not recognise it. In fact, no Asian country is going to recognise it. Nor will the European countries. China will fight. Win or lose, Taiwan will be devastated. Unfortunately, I met only very few Taiwanese leaders who recognised t, his reality. The problem is that it's not going to be just Taiwan which is going to be damaged. It will be a grave setback for the whole region. Our hope for China to emerge peacefully and for the region to prosper through investments and trade and tourism will be shattered.
In any case, I think it would be the height of absurdity for Singapore to want to quarrel with China over the question of Taiwan because the cross-straits issue is not a permanent problem. It will be resolved sooner or later – either sooner if matters come to a head when Taiwan amends its Constitution, or later, eventually, if the situation evolves peacefully over two or three decades, China continues to grow and Taiwan's economy is progressively integrated into China's economy. The process is inexorable; there can be no other final outcome.
I came back from Taiwan more troubled than before I went because the ruling party, the DPP, is preoccupied with domestic politics. Their immediate priority is the upcoming Legislative Yuan elections –立法院选举 – at the end of the year and they're going to go all out to have the Pan-Green parties win an absolute majority. On the KMT side, they're also preoccupied with domestic policies, with the shooting incident on March 19 when somebody tried to assassinate President Chen Shui-bian and also with the recounting of the last presidential election votes. So, neither side has had time to think about Taiwan's future, about the longer term, how to manage relations with China, how best to reconcile the aspirations of the Taiwanese people with the realities of their international position.
There is a stronger Taiwanese identity emerging. More people are speaking in the Taiwanese dialect, what they call 河洛语 is a Taiwanese form of Hokkien. Before Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian became President, most Taiwanese people considered themselves as Chinese. Now, many think of themselves as Taiwanese, not Chinese. Somebody told me they did a poll. You have a choice – are you Taiwanese, are you Taiwanese/Chinese, or are you Chinese? And a majority said, ""I am not Chinese, I am not Taiwanese/Chinese, I'm Taiwanese"". And the Green leaders, some of them tell me that they believe that a majority of the people of Taiwan support an independent Taiwan now, so that the idea of Taidu(Taiwan Independence) has now become a mainstream view in Taiwan society. But the Blue leaders questioned this because they said, ""Well, if you say independence is the status quo, yes, people like that. If you say independence is a declaration of independence, that's a different matter"". But the reality is the Green side believes that the majority is pro-independence and they may act on it.
The Taiwanese media are a freewheeling and parochial lot. They thrive on juicy news and speculation. They chased me around when I was in Taiwan. The 代表 (representative) asked me what I wanted to do for breakfast. I said, in the old days, I used to go to the coffeeshop, to have 豆浆油条 (fritters and soya bean drink). He says, ""No, no, no. You cannot go for豆浆油条 . We will bring the 豆浆油条to you because if you go out, you will be surrounded by the paparazzi and you will be more popular than 5566 (the Taiwanese boy band)”. So, it's a completely different media milieu. The newspapers cover almost exclusively domestic news, very little or no reporting of the situation in North Korea, of war against terrorism, or of the war in Iraq, or of the US elections.
So, I don't sense, therefore, that the Taiwanese people appreciate the international strategic environment. They don't understand how preoccupied the US is with the war in Iraq, how much they want to settle North Korea, how interdependent America and China have already become. Many also don't realise how rapidly China is transforming itself and how major powers in the world are repositioning themselves in response to a rising China. The problem is made worse because they have a rule that if you are a government officer, a political leader or a civil servant, you cannot visit China. So, the business people know, but the political leaders and the civil servants who are making policy, they can read the reports, but they have not seen firsthand Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Shenzhen, how China has changed and how Taiwan's position has changed.
Many Taiwanese believe that China will not use force on Taiwan even if it moves towards independence. They are wrong. I visited China in May. I met the top leaders. The cross-straits issue was at the top of their agenda and China is absolutely serious. For China, the 2008 Olympics is a small matter, but preventing Taiwanese independence is crucial to China.
The Taiwanese press, amongst other misreportings, speculated that I had visited Taiwan in order to play a mediator's role between Chinaand Taiwan. It showed that they didn't understand the situation. It's not just a misreporting, they didn't understand the core situation because I am in no position to play such a role and I have no desire to do so and the key thing is, they didn't understand that the issue between China and Taiwan is not a misunderstanding which 和事佬 (mediator) can come along and, you know, jolly both sides and resolve, then you shake hands like in Everitt Road. It's a fundamental and deep contradiction which will require great skill and restraint and wisdom on both sides to resolve and to manage.
Therefore, there is a real risk of miscalculation and mishap. If war breaks out across the straits, we will be forced to choose between the two sides. As a friend of both sides, any decision is going to be painful, but if the conflict is provoked by Taiwan, then Singapore cannot support Taiwan.
I will not change our one-China policy. But I had no choice but to make this visit to Taiwan in order to be confident that I can take the right decision for Singapore in a looming crisis.
We value our relations with China. I have met many senior Chinese leaders, most recently in May, and I deeply appreciated their goodwill and friendship and their warm welcome and their readiness to co-operate with Singapore. This co-operation has always been on the basis of equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit – 平等互惠互利 – that's their slogan and that's ours too. If our co-operation is affected, both sides will lose.
I regret that my visit to Taiwan has caused this severe reaction in China which affected relations. I also regret the way the Taiwanese media chose to play up my private and unofficial visit.This isn't going to be the last time our relations with a major friendly power are strained. We strive for good relations with all countries, but from time to time issues are going to arise and big powers have their own interests and will exercise their influence to get their way. We may be old friends, but when our interests diverge, or even when our approaches to the same problem differ, they have to put their interests first and their approaches first and so must we. This is a reality of the compelling pressures of international politics and of national interests and we must remember this.
Let me move on to domestic affairs now and talk about restructuring the economy, which I think, for many Singaporeans, is the item at the top of your agenda.
Our economy is doing well because we have been restructuring it, because we have been taking the painful but necessary steps and we have made ourselves competitive and so, this year, we've got 10 per cent growth in the first half and maybe 8 or 9 per cent for the year. It's because of restructuring, it's not by chance. The challenge for us is how to continue growing and the answer is, well, we've got to continue to restructure, we've got to continue to upgrade.
It's difficult, it's painful, it's tiring, but it's not just Singapore. It's a worldwide trend because of globalisation. It's happening everywhere. There is ferocious competition. The developed countries are facing it, in America, in Europe. The developing countries are facing it, China andIndia. We see them as ferocious competitors. They see other China men and other Indians as ferocious competitors. So, we are afraid of 1,300 million Chinese, maybe. They are afraid of 1,299 million Chinese, too. And the competition is ferocious. So, the result is less job security, more need to adapt as the market changes. And overall, if you look at it in broad trends, I think in the developing countries, where they've upgraded themselves and got their infrastructure right and their rules right and their conditions right, like the coastal cities in China, like some cities in India, I think that their incomes will rise because they are very cheap now.
In the developed countries, in Germany where they have too much social welfare and they can't afford it; in America where their wages are very high and things can be done cheaper overseas, even for programmers, even for skilled workers, even doctors, I think in the developed countries, the incomes are going to fall. So the bottom is going to come up and the top is going to come down, we are somewhere in between. What happens to us? I think we have to try and push our incomes up and to do that, we have to restructure, upgrade, improve our productivity and make our labour markets more flexible so that when the conditions change, when business change, we can also get our companies to alter, to adapt, to get into the new business and get out of the old business so that they can continue to be productive and can continue to make a living for Singaporeans.
So, we talk about wage reform. It's not just flexible wages, a few more bonuses here and there, the MVC (Monthly Variable Component), but defining goals for the company, setting goals for the workers, rewarding them according to their goals. It's what people call KPIs, key performance indicators. So, you have a key performance indicator – how many boxes you move or how many chips you make, how low your defect rate is, getting people motivated to do the right thing so that they will be productive, so that they will align their interests and they can earn a good living.
And that's what we have been trying to do this year – we've had a tripartite taskforce, we had recommendations in January, we've made good progress – hotels, banks, some other sectors have restructured already and other companies should also follow, especially the SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises) who find it more difficult. And the economy is picking up. In fact, that's a good time to restructure because then you can build up the buffer of the variable bonus. When the economy is down, the fear is there, but the pain is great. So, I think do it now.
We also have to raise our productivity, which means retraining workers but also means restructuring the companies and I think we can do it. PSA and HDB restructured last year.
PSA particularly had a very difficult exercise, but they've done it and they have done well. They had to drop about 600 workers, they had to slash costs to the bone, they had to retrain their people, cut their prices to their customers so as to lock them in and get them signed on. But they have turned around. The volume is up, profits are up, KPIs have been met, bonuses will be paid and the customers say there's a new PSA now because when there's a problem, the PSA staff will go to the company to ask the company, ""How can I help you?"" rather than wait for the company to come and then say, ""Well, sorry, it's your problem, you look after it"". So, PSA has changed and as PSA has done, other companies have to do too.
It will not be the last one because many others will be necessary. SIA is one company which is in this category. You know all about SIA also. You've seen what Senior Minister has said, you've seen what SIA unions have said. We know that the unions are discussing this, negotiating with the company and making good progress, particularly the NTUC affiliates. But let me just add this – it's not just the LCCs (low cost carriers) which are the problem, it's not just Bangkok Airport which is the problem. The problem is that SIA's competitors used to be very poor and are now quite good. So, SIA's margin used to be very comfortable, but now, it's much less. If you fly one of the other airlines, you will find that they're not bad at all, but 20 years ago, it was different.
I give you one example again. I went to China 20 years ago for the first time. In those days, SIA didn't fly, so I flew a Chinese airline,Singapore to Beijing. It's about six hours, quite a long flight. The service was abysmal. We got onto the aeroplane about 11 o'clock, and I said, ""What are we going to eat for lunch?'' So, I saw these boxes coming onto the aeroplane, little white boxes, paper boxes, and they passed them down the corridor from passenger to passenger. Each passenger, one, that's your 打包 (takeaways). Dim sum inside – cold, greasy, salty, unappetising, a few toothpicks, so you can help yourself. I was sitting in front, First Class. So, I thought, maybe First Class passenger, they'll give me special treatment. Let's see what happens. So, they went all the way down, they reached the First Class. We got special treatment – we got two boxes each.
That was 20 years ago. Today, you fly a Chinese airline, the air hostess comes, she serves you wine, she gives you food, here is the menu. Would you like a newspaper, sir? The arrival, the temperature is such and such, remember to wear a coat. Would you like a blanket? It's different.
So, SIA's competition is different and SIA knows this and I hope their executives go and ride other airlines regularly to make sure they know what's happening and I think their workers also should ride other airlines from time to time and I think that this is a reality which SIA and its unions have to confront together and to deal with. And they will do it.

And so will other companies. And I think the Civil Service also has to do it because if the Civil Service is the only place where you have an iron rice bowl, we’ll have a problem. Then we'll have more Duck and Hippo stories.
So, we've got to continue running the marathon. I know that some Singaporeans worry that new PM, maybe very fierce and may push Singaporeans to run even faster.

You've watched Home Run, right? I watched it a couple of nights ago, taking a break from writing this speech. You watch the race – Ah Kun, he had lousy shoes, tattered and torn, shared with his sister. It disappeared half-way down the race, but he won because he wanted to win and I think it's that spirit, that determination, that guts which we've got to have if we are going to want to run and win.
I understand what restructuring means for companies and for workers and for the unions and for the families. Retrenchment is a very emotional experience for everybody – for the workers, for the IROs (industrial relations officers), for the employers, for the human resource people. In PSA's retrenchment exercise, everybody was involved. It was a wrenching experience, I think everybody wept. Even the management wept because they've never had to do this before but at the end of it, it was done. I think it was done well and the union leaders and the IROs were given PBMs and BBMs in this year's National Day for their blood, sweat and tears. We salute them.
Other cases are less wrenching. We have more time to prepare. I think it's less of a shock to the workers. We can get them prepared psychologically. We can have those more willing to go arranged to leave earlier, but even then, many families are affected and even those with jobs are worried and unsettled because, they say “will I be next?” So, we will do our best to support and to help those who are affected because we have to look after them, not only when they lose a job but to help them to find a new one, especially the older workers. And that means we need retraining programmes and we need to restructure and redesign jobs so that workers will be able to do these new jobs. The programmes are there. We have many retraining programmes, but the workers have to make an effort because if they don't make an effort, it's going to be difficult for them to do it.I recently watched a video Othman Harun showed me made by Mendaki and WDA (Workforce Development Agency) to encourage workers to change jobs because you can make any number of speeches until your throat gets hoarse, but you need real-life examples of people who have made this transition, who have learnt new skills, who have been able to cross over. So, this was an effort by Mendaki in Malay and it was called ""Kalau Hendak, Seribu Daya"". I thought it was a good movie, just 10, 15 minutes and it showed four stories, but one particularly struck me. It was a widow, Madam Hafidah Maaruf. She had five children she was looking after, the eldest doing 'O' levels. She was a cook when she got retrenched. Then she attended a reflexologist/masseuse course. Very tough, but she persevered and she completed the course with her children's help and she set up business in a fitness centre. I'll just quote what she said in Malay: ""Mula saya merasa takut juga, pasal apa saya bukan dari aliran Inggeris atau Melayu, saya dari sekolah Arab, saya tak begitu faham. Adalah juga masalah masalah yang saya hadapi. Apabila saya pulang ke rumah guru guru saya adalah anak anak saya.""
In other words, ""at first I felt afraid, because I was not from the English or the Malay stream, I was from the Arabic stream, which means a madrasah. So, I met many difficulties, but when I went home, my teachers were my children"". So, she had the guts to make the transition and to change over and become a reflexologist. It's not easy. Her business is not doing very, very well, but I wish her well and I think with her spirit, she will be able to make it.
The other thing we have to do to help the retrenched workers and people who lose their jobs is job redesign because there are jobs at the bottom, but they are not attractive. They are dirty, they are sweaty, they are tiring, unpleasant but if we can restructure them, I think we can make them more attractive to Singaporeans, pay better, make more sense for Singaporeans to do.
Lim Swee Say has been doing this in ENV (Ministry of Environment) and now, he's gone back to NTUC. I think this is going to be one of the key things on his plate. So, he explained to me, he says, at hawker centres, the hawker assistant picks up the plates and washes them, he’s usually in a pair of slippers, dirty singlet, torn shorts. He takes the thing, he takes a dirty pail of water, sloshes it around, declares it a clean plate. So, now, he's organised them, there’re proper uniforms, proper hot water machines to clean the plates, pride of work, proper standards and hygiene, better pay. And the hawkers who get better service are willing to pay for this to get their plates and dishes washed. It makes sense. So, he says 1,000 x 1,000, 1,000 jobs for S$1,000 per job, let's create these 1,000 jobs for a start, 1,000 by 1,000. He's got about 500 or 600.
I asked him, what other examples? He says, well, town councils. Town council cleaners are paid very poorly. Very often, you see foreign workers, sometimes illegally employed by the subcontractor, cheap, but the job is quick and dirty and they finish by 10 o'clock in the morning. So, because they finish by 10 o'clock in the morning by contract, you only have three or four hours in the morning to clean the floor. Therefore, you can only clean very few number of flats every day. Therefore, the wages are poor, S$600. Why do you want to stop at ten o'clock in the morning? The town councils say, this way, when the residents come out, the place looks clean. So, he says, why not stop by two o'clock in the afternoon? So, when the residents come out, they see people cleaning it and they feel happy it's being cleaned. But anyway, if you do it at two o'clock in the afternoon, you have a longer period, you can do more work, you can clean more, you can be paid more and you can get more Singaporeans to do it.
So, I think these are practical ways we can do things in cleaning. In other industries, too, I think we should pay some attention to this so as to help the workers at the bottom who are out of work find work. We have foreign workers, yes, they are a great help to our economy and we need them, but we also have to help to restructure our jobs so that Singaporeans can do them, and will do them.
Besides jobs, one of the things Singaporeans worry about is the cost of living. A lot of people worry about the cost of living going up and, indeed, some prices have gone up – electricity, you know, because of oil prices. S&C charges have gone up because we haven't revised them for more than 10 years and we have to raise charges if we are going to maintain standards and clean the estates properly. Even prices of chickens and eggs have gone up recently. I think these can't be helped, but overall, our prices have been stable, yet many people still worry about it. So, I think we have to understand this worry and see what we can do about it.
I think for most Singaporeans, the reason why they feel cost of living is up is because wages have come down, bonuses have shrunk and so, belts have been tightened and for everyone, a little bit of an increase hurts. And they are committed because they plan on a house of a certain size, they have obligations, they have old folks to look after, children to send to schools and so on. Also, to be quite frank, expectations have gone up. In the old days, very few people had aircons. Today, when people come to me with an electricity bill problem in Meet-the-People Sessions, I ask them, ""Do you turn on your aircon?"" He says, ""Only for a short while at night"". I'm sure if I do a show of hands tonight, there'll be many aircons in this room. And handphones, too. People come to see us with financial problems. They need the handphone, they feel they must have it and I can understand these are conveniences and comfort items which people want, but you have to realise that they do cost something and that's part of the reason why you feel that money is tight. So, that's one reason why people feel the cost of living is up.
The other groups, of course, are the low-income groups and they have difficulties because for them every increase, however small, is an unwelcome one and we've got various financial assistance schemes and programmes to help them, to help them tide over and to help them find jobs. But I think there are some concrete things which we can also do to help them. I'll just give you one small example. I've seen so many, people come and say ""electricity cut off"" because it's been dragged – promise to pay, promise to pay, promise to pay, then finally cut off. So they come to us for help. I say, ""What are you going to do?"" He says, ""I'll pay instalments"". So I write “they will pay instalments”. After two instalments, stop, cut off again. It's not a solution. So, I told MTI and SingPower, “how about going for pay-as-you-use; cashcard?” Then I don't have to cut off, you pay back part of the old account and as you use you pay. Your children need to study, you have medicines to look after you, you can afford to use the electricity because you are paying as you go along and I solve your problem and you avoid my problem. So, I think SingPower is going to do that. I think it will be of some help, but still, we will have to work with these families to help them get their lives back on track. So, cost of living is a problem, but really, the long-term solution for the cost of living problem is growth because with growth, you have incomes, you have jobs, you have better standards of living and you can meet your obligations.
Medical cost is the other element of cost which people worry about. Many Singaporeans worry. On the ground, you can feel it. They tell you, ""we dare not get sick"". Actually, most people don't have a problem but some people might have a problem. If the bills are big, everybody is scared. So, I think we have to do something about this. We have Medisave, it's a good scheme. We have MediShield, which gives you insurance, which helps but is not adequate and needs to be revamped and Khaw Boon Wan's principal job is to work on this and try and see what we can do to update the MediShield system to make it work better for Singaporeans. You have to pay more premiums, it cannot be helped, but we will be able to come up with a better scheme which will give you better protection and which will look after you in case of ill-health and will save you a lot of worry.
Last week, in my swearing-in speech, I talked about the young generation, the new generation. Unfortunately, as a result of talking about the young generation, I have caused the older Singaporeans and even some not-so-old ones to feel left out. So, one MP emailed me. I'll read just a little bit from his email. He says, ""The focus appears to be on youth and vitality for your new term, but I wish to point out that there's a large representation of Singaporeans in the 45 to 60 age group whom we must continue to engage and attend to. This group has suffered and borne the brunt of the downturn, mostly in stolid silence. They need to be nursed to regain their self-confidence and pride"". He's right, but let me say I haven't forgotten because I'm in this group.
I know what the concerns of the older Singaporeans are – it’s job security. We’ve talked about it just now. Medical costs, we talked about it just now too, but the old folks are particularly worried because it affects them more directly. Financial security in old age. Will their CPF be enough? And also an elder-friendly living environment. What does that mean? It means LUP – lift upgrading – it's the most popular of all our upgrading programmes. Never mind the fancy roof, never mind the fountains, never mind the covered walkways, well, covered walkways, we still want, but lifts first because when you are old, when you have to climb the stairs, when you have somebody in a wheelchair, if you are not on a lift landing, you have a problem. And I think we can do something about that and focus on the LUP. There are other practical things which we must adjust as our population ages. Boon Heng tells me, lift doors close too quickly because you are walking in and before you can get in, your tongkat (walking stick)gets stuck. Or traffic lights change too fast for the pedestrians. These are real problems. I think as our population ages, we have to adjust and we have to make these adjustments for them.
And we also need, besides the physical adjustments, the psychological support networks, the community support networks, the outreach groups, the qigong groups, the mutual help groups in the constituencies, even the mahjong groups – some outlet for the old folks to come down to have friends, to have people to care for them so that they will not be lonely when their children are out at work. So, we will address these concerns and I should also say that we will continue our asset enhancement policy and distribute surpluses when we have surpluses and when we do, we will give senior citizens more, especially to their Medisave. It won't be as easy as before because our belts have all been tightened, including the Government's, but when we have something to distribute, we will remember the older Singaporeans more. I think we owe them and they more than deserve it.
For the future, we have to focus on the post-independence generation. They are different from their parents, they've grown up in different circumstances, they have different points of reference, different expectations, different values, much more exposed to the outside world. And it's the same all over Asia. I was in Korea recently and they gave me a definition of youth. They said, a young man is somebody who can do an SMS with one hand with the phone in his pocket. And they should know because in Korea, young men like that changed the Government. They kicked out all the old team and they put in a totally new team with no experience. But then I came home and found out that the world SMS champion is a 23-year-old Singaporean girl.
But I'm proud and confident of this new generation. I've met some of them in Footprints of a Nation, a TV programme two years ago. More recently, the younger ministers. Vivian, Khaw Boon Wan, Eng Hen and company were in i-Contact, a TV series. I was impressed with them (the young students). They are not all from the top schools. They are idealistic, they are articulate, they have high ambitions and they are growing up to be responsible adults on the cusp of adulthood, just the point of no longer being a child, able to think broader, more responsibly, participate and speak up with confidence. And we are distinguishing ourselves internationally. We do well. I've noticed recently we won Robocup soccer. I don't know what it was. What it is is you programme robots to play football and our robots were smarter than other people's robots, which means our robot programmers were smarter than other people's robot programmers. We go for choir competitions, we win gold medals and we distinguish ourselves academically too.
We have a social conscience. There are many young groups which are organised and do social work. Last year, I went to one function organised by Mercy Relief, which I was impressed with. They were started off by a Malay group, by Perdaus and they have gone beyond being a Malay group to stand on their own as a multiracial, secular group doing international work, 700 young volunteers of all races, students, professionals, organising themselves, raising funds and they're doing humanitarian work for refugees in Cambodia and Afghanistan, and flood victims. So, I asked them, ""Are you going to Iraq?"" They said, ""Maybe later on"". But they have the spirit and they have the goal and they will do it.
And the young people are willing to try different paths. We have a Sports School. The response is good. We are building an Arts School. We already have NAFA and SIA-LaSalle and they are doing well. They have very good students and they go in for all kinds of courses. And even fashion design, we have Singaporeans winning prizes. Recently, I was walking along the Esplanade on the waters by the sea and I found young people drawing beautiful pictures on the pavement using chalk. So, I thought to myself – 15 years ago, we might have caned them, but today, we have MITA or MICA (Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts). So, I think that we have changed.
Well, there is a spectrum. Not all are engaged. I read, I think in Today that they went along Orchard Road and asked who's the PM and some people didn't know. What to do? And there are some who have difficult backgrounds and lack opportunities. But by and large, we have groomed a strong generation ready for the future. And we have to groom this generation, to give them wings and to give them roots. We need to give them wings, expose them to the world, build their character, let them set their own goals and choices, let them learn from their own mistakes, let them grow and blossom and be themselves. Guide them, but don't constrain them. But we also have to give them roots, emotional experiences which will bind them here, playing together with each other, roughing it out, taking challenges together because then, they will create friendships, they will create ties, they will have memories and bonds to their friends and to the places where they made these friends. So, even with wings, they will fly all over the world but come back and be a Singaporean in Singapore. And so, I renamed MCDS to become MCYS, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, and I appointed Vivian as the Minister. He is the youngest in the Cabinet and I think that they will be able to spark off something to engage the young people to get them enthused in this project of Singapore. A lot of this has to do with education, which I will talk about later on.
One critical aspect of rooting Singaporeans here is to empower them, to give them a say in their lives, to make them feel that they can make a difference. If you are in China or in America, you can't do that. One person out of 1.3 billion, can you change China? How many can become like Deng Xiaoping? If you were one person out of nearly 300 million in America, can you become the President and change America? How many people can go on stage and say, ""I am John Kerry, I am reporting for duty""? But in Singapore, you can and you must.
My generation felt that and that's why when we went to university, we felt and I felt I had to come home, there was an obligation, I had to serve. The SAF sent me. I studied Maths. After one year, I took the exams. My tutor met me. He says, ""You must stay on"". I said, ""But I have to go home. I've got an obligation. I've got a bond"". He says, ""Forget about the bond. You must do Maths"". I said, ""I can't. I have to go back. People depend on me"". In a big country, I can say, ""Chuck it! I am doing Maths. Somebody else will look after the country"". Three million, you may or may not be in politics, but your contribution does count. People expect you, they send you, they want you back. You have to go back and do what is the right thing and you can make a difference. There is a lot of things to do, a lot you can shape. I think I persuaded him. When I came back, I think I made the right decision and many people of my generation did that, too, and we've got to get this new generation to feel the same. We've got to involve them in the community and in national affairs, to take ownership of the country and of the problems.
Don't ask what the Government is going to do. I read that some people are asking, now that you want young people to get engaged, what is the Government going to do to get young people engaged? Actually, we are going to wait. No, get up, do it. Nike says, ""Just Do It"". Engage your ideals, your ideas, your energies, build a new generation, build tomorrow's Singapore. Don't wait or depend on the Government. Find your own leaders, organise your own solutions, move. Politics is not the only way you can do it. There are many ways to contribute. You can be in community service, you can be in social work, you can be in education, you can be in the arts. But politics is one way to do it and it's important that enough people come into politics so that we have self-renewal and we have a new leadership team.
Political self-renewal is critical to Singapore. Chok Tong started talent-scouting before he became PM. That's how I came in, aged 32, one of the youngest, in 1984. But all the people who came in with me in 1984 were in their 30s – Lee Boon Yang, Yeo Cheow Tong, Wong Kan Seng, Tarmugi, Mah Bow Tan, who contested in Potong Pasir, we were all in our 30s. We didn't think of ourselves as being particularly young, but I suppose, if you look back now, we are because if you compare it with the people who came in in 2001 when we tried very hard and had a lot of young people, our seven MOS (Minister-of-State) from 2001 – the Seven Samurais, I think we call them – their average age is 43 years old and the youngest one was Vivian, who was then 40. So, we need to have young people come in in their 30s, then you have time to learn, to develop. In your 30s, you are not ready to take charge, but you are ready to learn, to absorb and you are young enough to absorb and then in your 40s, you are tested, you've gained the experience and then 50s, you can take charge. You are energetic but ready to go. And so, we have an experienced team today.
And I've got to do the same. I can connect with the young people. I mean, if I do another Footprints of a Nation, I think I'm okay, or i-Contact. But the generation after that who are now five and six years old, I think they will need new leaders by the time they become 21. I met one of these young men recently in a block party in my constituency. He came up to me. He says, ""我认识你，李显龙"" (I recognise you, Lee Hsien Loong). I was very pleased, obviously, not one of the Orchard Road types. So, I said, ""你怎么知道 ?"" (how do you know?). He said: ”“电视上，第八波道” (on television, Channel 8). So, I was very pleased. You know, future voter, calculating, 2012, 2016. So, I decided to tease him. I said,“你搞错了，那个人是我的弟弟 ”. He mixed it up, that’s my brother. He says, “是你.” (no, it’s you). Why? “白头发”, white hair. So, by the time he is voting, he is going to look at me and say, “白头发”, I think he wants somebody with a little less white hair. So, we've got to find the people. When Mr Lee Kuan Yew became PM, he was 35 years old. Those were revolutionary times. When Goh Chok Tong became PM, he was 49. I became PM, I'm 52. For the next PM, I think we have to try harder.
So, come forward to serve. Don't wait to be asked and if you know your friend, somebody whom you think is capable, put his name up, we will take a look at him because Singaporeans are shy. Sometimes, they're afraid, you put yourself forward, ""毛遂自荐"" -- people may misunderstand that you are offering yourself and perhaps you've got an agenda. But if you know somebody else who is good, who's doing good work quietly, let us know, we will try him out. We want you to be part of our team. We don't mind if you have different views, but you must have some views. If you have no views, I have a problem. If you have different views, we can talk about it and let's do something about it together.
The most important gift that we can give to our young and to prepare for their future is education. It's not just preparing them for a job, but learning to live a life, learning to deal with the world, learning to be a full person, what in Chinese, they say, ""xue zhuo ren"" (学做人) and in schools, there are plenty of opportunities to learn to be a person. Tonight, I will talk about primary and secondary education because that's where all the children go and that's one of the key issues for young parents who are starting families.
Our school system has gone through many improvements over the years. In fact, some people say too many improvements, too many changes. But we've done many things. We've got more qualified teachers, we've got independent schools, we've got more autonomous schools, we've got Normal (Technical) stream in the secondary schools. So, the students aren't just sent out to vocational schools or some place else. And we've made all these improvements, show results internationally in our achievement tests – Maths, Science, Physics – and the numbers going to post-secondary education and the quality of the people going into the workforce. But beyond what we have got, I think we cannot just do more of the same because if you just do more of the same, you are just going to get incremental improvements. You need a qualitative change, a quantum leap to get different sort of education, different sort of results. And that's why we have been moving to a more flexible and more diverse education system. We've got integrated programmes in schools, we've got a Sports Schools, art schools, maths and science schools. We are offering people more choice and we are better able to groom special talents and spot ability all across the spectrum, different kinds of ability.
So, what do we do? To get a better feel for this, I recently met 10 school principals, five primary schools, five secondary schools, with Tharman. I spent two hours with them. It was a most educational experience for me because I listened to them, their experiences, what they were doing, what they felt they could do better, what they were proud of and how their children were measuring up or not and what they were worried about and I think there's a lot we can do to help them. Teachers have a most challenging job because they are not just teaching, marking assignments or running the school day by day. Those are the routine things. That, you learn in IE. But you have to know every student, provide individualised teaching, coaching where needed, and help the pupils to learn beyond the classroom and in life, through interaction. They call it ""experiential learning"". It's a big word, but what does it mean? It means you have to think of new ways to get them to engage, to do something and, by doing something, to hoist in an indelible experience.
So, I give you two examples. Tanjong Katong Girls School, TKGS -- they sent their whole Secondary Three cohort to Outward Bound Schoolfor five days, teachers as well as students, conducted classes there. So, you do the Outward Bound routine, you camp, you rough it out, you do the physical part, test out your character, experience the ruggedness and so, challenge each other and put their leadership skills to the test. Education Ministry can't order this. The schools must want to do this. Another school, Hougang Primary, they said children come from working-class households, may not have opportunities at home. The principal went round and bought a few old discarded pianos and put them around the school compound in the school premises, so that some of the children can play, and some of them can listen to the playing. And so, they also have access to music. I think it shows initiative and it's not just the principals showing initiative. You really want the teachers and the students also to show initiative.
Shuqun, another secondary school, I think, from quite a tough neighbourhood. They've got students who came to see the principal because they said nearby, there is a video arcade. The students go there, mix with bad company. ""Why don't you give me an empty classroom, buy me one Xbox and one Playstation and I will organise a good video arcade inside the school?"" So, the principal said, ""Are you sure?"" He says,""Ya, we will take charge."" But you need somebody to be there to make sure that children in the video arcade aren't doing wrong things in school. So, they organised the parents to be chaperones, to sit in and oversee and so, they have a video arcade going and they got a system. If people want to bring in a game, somebody will vet the game to make sure it's not X-rated and then they can play the game in this safe environment, in their video arcade. They may not be top students, but they are students with initiative. And so, we have to help not just the students in the top end in the schools where they are bright but also across the spectrum because we've got to get the weaker students to believe in themselves, to show them how they can achieve, to set targets for themselves which are realistic and map out ways for them to succeed which fit their abilities and aptitudes. Every student has his strength and he can accomplish something. If you can identify it, he can do something.
Last year, Wanbao told the story of one student – during Sars, he got HQO, father was in Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market. Father got HQO, son got HQO, Home Quarantine Order, spent 10 days at home, Normal (Technical) student. What did he do? He had learnt Excel Spreadsheet in school. So, in 10 days, he computerised his father's chicken stall accounts. It's quite something. So, Normal (Technical) doesn't mean ""bodoh""(stupid). I mean, these are kids with something in their aptitude if you can unlock it.
Naval Base Secondary School, they also have students from a wide spectrum. They have Normal (Academic) students, some of them doing art. The school organised for them to raise funds to go on a field trip, 20 students to Paris. So, they made artworks, they sold their artworks, they raised their funds and they competed to go on the trip. One of the things they have to do is to stop smoking because good behaviour is needed. They go to the principal and say, ""I stopped smoking one month. Can I go to Paris?"" They raised enough, they went. It's a life-transforming experience for them. They came back with tremendous pride. So, one says to the other, ""I saw a Picasso. Did you?"" I haven't seen a Picasso. And they did well. At the end, they all passed their art. One third got distinctions.
So, there are many things like this which you can do, through interaction, through activities. By working together, you build character, team spirit, leadership and you give hope and you put people onto the right path. It's much better than formal education because education is about every experience in school and not just a classroom. I came away from the two hours I spent with the principals very encouraged by their vision, by their drive, by their ideas and their idealism. I think that a good, dedicated set of principals and staff is the critical X-factor if we want our schools to improve, the key to quality and diversity. It's not theories, it's not principles, it's not just the edicts you put out from the Ministry of Education. It's the people in the schools. Who are they? Are they committed to this? Will they do it or not? And I think we have a dedicated group of teachers and principals and quite a few outstanding ones. And if we can get more of them, more good people, then, of course, our schools can be even better.
So, we've got to give the schools more resources and more teachers and then, they can make this qualitative leap. And we are going to do that. It will take time, but we will get additional teachers – 1,000 more for the primary schools, 1,400 more for the secondary schools, 550 more for the JCs (Junior Colleges) and I think we can get this by 2010, over the next six years. And overall, this will mean we'll have 15 per cent more teachers per student and it will make a difference in every school because it will help ensure that every student in the next generation emerges confident, fighting fit.
What will we do with these teachers? I think we leave the schools to decide. They have their ideas, they have conviction of their ideas, let them decide. Each school has different students, it’s got different needs and the principals I met had different plans. Some want to shrink their class sizes so that the teachers can give more attention to their students. Some want to go for specialised teaching so that you'll have proper teachers teaching art, teaching music, teaching PE, rather than just generalised teaching by whoever is assigned. We don't have that yet in our primary schools. So, a teacher teaching art may not be qualified to teach art. The teacher teaching music, I hope she can sing. But if we have a few more teachers, then we can make sure of it, train them and improve the standards. In some schools, they will devote the extra resources to counselling, for character-building or other special programmes like pastoral programmes.
I think that there are a lot we can do, and which we will do. But there is one thing which we shouldn't do and that is when we add more teachers, we better don't add more homework or increase the syllabus because that just defeats the whole purpose. Then we are back to square one. In fact, I think we should cut down on some of this syllabus. It would mean less pressure on the kids, a bit less rote learning, more space for them to explore and discover their talents and also more space for the teachers to think, to reflect, to find ways to bring out the best in their students and to deliver quality results. We've got to teach less to our students so that they will learn more. Grades are important – don't forget to pass your exams – but grades are not the only thing in life and there are other things in life which we want to learn in school.
Parents are part of this and they've got to support the efforts of the schools when the schools are trying new teaching methods, or when they are trying to build character, or just toughening them up a little. I know some parents have gone to schools to complain, to say, ""The other school has more worksheets"". Even some kindergarten parents are complaining that their children are not getting worksheets and some kindergarten students are attending remedial classes. No need. Let them grow up in their own time.
I know children are precious, we’ve got one, sometimes two. So, it's different. If we have four or five, well, you take a different attitude. But even with one or two, as parents, I think we have to let go a little. Take some risks as parents so that the children can learn, take some knocks, take some risks, grow up. It's okay for children to get hurt. They fall down, bruise their knee, knock themselves, a few scrapes, can't be helped, it's part of growing up. If you grow up with no scars anywhere, and you've never fallen off a bicycle, I think you are a different sort of person. I think not all parents are like this, to be quite fair. If you read the newspapers recently, we've had a lot of articles, letters, parents who feel their children should have more room to play, let them play football, let them get sweaty, use the PE periods for the right things, don't let it be eaten up by homework. I agree with them. I think Tharman agrees with them, too, and I think the MOE agrees with them and will do something about it.
One particular aspect of education which a lot of parents worry about and which I want to talk about tonight is mother tongue, particularly Chinese language. We need to learn our mother tongue, both for our self-identity, and also because of Asia coming up… China, India… we need to be in with it. The Europeans are learning Asian languages. If we don't, we are fools. I went to a semi-conductor factory in Shanghai. They showed me around, I found a woman there, European, speaking perfect Beijing hua (北京话) giving instructions. I think she was in charge of HR. So, I asked her, ""你的华语是什么地方学的？ (where did you learn your Mandarin?)"", trying to put on my best Beijing qiang (accent). ""是不是在北京学的?(Is it in Beijing?). She said, ""在北京 ，也在威尼斯 "", (I learn it in Beijing and Venice). So, she learnt, she went to China and now, she's found a job. So if we want jobs, we better learn to speak too.
I went to Korea. They've got 35,000 students in China now learning Chinese. If we don't get our young people to learn the language, I think we are at a tremendous disadvantage. It will be a great loss. It's not easy, I can tell you from my own experience, either to learn the language or to maintain currency. I spent 12 years in a Chinese school – first language, Chinese, but my first language was English and till today, if I don't use Chinese after a few weeks or a few months, it gets rusty. “生锈了” (rusty) is the politest description and when CNA comes and wants to interview me, I have to practise and work on it, brush up and get the vocabulary and the grammar and the flow and the intonation back again before I am presentable. That's the way language is learnt, but that's what you have to do. It's part of my job, it's worth the effort and each time I visit China or Taiwan or Hong Kong, I realise what a valuable asset I have to be able to talk to them, understand them and have them feel that I understand them, but always remembering that I am Singaporean, they are Chinese or PRC Chinese.
So, we've got to get our mother tongue, Chinese language education properly done in schools. It's a sweat for a lot of kids. It's difficult to do, but it's something which we have to improve on. What are our objectives? I will put three. First, we must establish at least a basic literacy for every Chinese student, basic modicum, everybody must pass, be able to speak, be able to listen, write a little bit, read a little bit more, but speak and listen. Secondly, we want to arouse an abiding interest in the Chinese Language (CL). We want people to want the language. If you make them fed-up with it, you have failed. If they hate it, you've wasted your time and if you try too hard, that may happen. You can try too hard in school, you can try too hard at home as parents and everyday read “成语故事” (stories of idioms). After a while they say, ""How about Mickey Mouse or Harry Potter?""
We've got to arouse interest and for those who can go further and have an interest in it, I think we should help them to go further to develop an abiding interest in the language, in the culture, in the society and in the contemporary events in China, what's happening now, not just what's happening hundreds of years ago. So, we've got to adapt our teaching of CL to our different pupils, to the different language backgrounds of the students, firstly, because whether you come from a Chinese language background at home or an English-speaking background is a tremendous difference to your starting point when you are in P1 (Primary 1) and you have to acknowledge that when you teach.
We've got to acknowledge the wide range of language abilities of our pupils. Some can be bicultural, almost equally facile in both languages, some master just one, and already struggling. Others master one and a second at a CL2 level or CL2-minus level. They are different. You have to acknowledge that they are different and even among siblings, some will go for CL1, some will struggle with CLB (simplified Chinese Language B syllabus). We have to acknowledge this and adapt. If you force CLB pupils to memorise strokes and phrases and characters and proverbs, regardless of aptitude, then you are just going to turn them off. But if we help them learn the language, if we help them use it in daily life, give them opportunities to try it out, to make use of it, to see that it's a living language, to know the stories behind the proverbs, then we can arouse their interest, then we can lay a foundation in their minds which will be a permanent foundation. So, later on in life, if they are going to China, if they are going to work there, six months a year, with the immersion, they will improve and they can use the language. Get enough so that if you go and you need to use it later on, you can revive it, warm it up and it's there. But the foundation must be there.
And we've got to teach the language as a living language, not as an academic subject, not like a dead language like Latin. So, this means focusing on spoken – 听，讲, listen and speak – less emphasis on writing, a little bit more emphasis on reading. Still learn to write and the Higher Chinese people will learn to read and write equally, but for the people who are going to use it in their daily lives, listening and speaking, I think, is easier, is achievable and we should shift the weight so that more of the weight is on listening, speaking and reading, less on writing. And I think we will have a better result that way. We also have to establish a conducive environment outside the classroom where the students can speak CL to each other and can reinforce the learning of the language.
So, I think what we need and what MOE is going to do is a modular approach, have different modules for different students. Everybody will do the core module, that's standard. If you are a weak student, we will give you additional foundation modules, bridging, reinforcement. So, you will learn the lessons a bit more, where you didn't quite master it, you catch up. If you have the skills, if you want to go further, we should let you do it. Not just the top 10 per cent or 20 per cent or even the top 30 per cent, but any student who has that language skill, let him do it, have enrichment modules, advanced modules, he can learn more. And I think this way, with a tailor-made system, each person, as they say in Chinese, ""因材施教"" – adapt your teaching to the talent you have, to the talent of each student, then I think we'll have a better result and a more effective outcome.
At the top, of course, we want some students who are almost equally proficient in English as well as Chinese. I think what we should aim to do is to develop a core, maybe about 200 students, who are in a bicultural programme, who will master Chinese language and culture, who will understand contemporary China. So, we will develop a programme – we've been working on it – which is more focused, more intensive. It will include a segment where the students are immersed in China, spend a few months there or a few weeks there, studying, living with a family and we will have a scholarship programme. We call it the SAP Scholarship because we're going to do this in the SAP schools, just like we have a Promsho programme and a Promsho Scholarship. So, the SAP Scholarship will provide the core and they can study, and beyond that, they will get scholarships to go on, we hope, Chinese university combined with someone in the West and they can come back, they can serve, can be in the public sector, can be in the private sector, can be on their own in business eventually. With this bilingual ability, I think they will be in demand.
This is just a sketch. The details will come later, but the key thing is we have to adapt our language teaching for Chinese and what we do for Chinese, we should also do for our other languages because we are a multiracial society, not a Chinese society.
Individuals may be bicultural, but as a society, we have to be multicultural and within our society, we must have people who understand Malaysia, who understand Indonesia, who know India, who know the region and who can connect us up with it and take advantage of the opportunities there and help us to understand our neighbours and interpret them so that we are not in a different world from the rest of the people living in our region.
The same problems in teaching Chinese, I think, apply to the other languages, too. I know many Tamil parents or Indian parents, their children learning Tamil, tell me their children sweat blood, so we have to work at their standards because we have to set them at a realistic level. The Malay students, I don't have so much of a problem because up to now, most Malay families speak Malay at home, but we are beginning to see, 1 or 2 per cent Malay families, professionals speak English at home, going to school, Malay is a foreign language. So, we will have to, what we do for Chinese, I think we will also do, when there is a demand for the Malays and for the Indians, not just to be fair, but to do the right thing and to make sure that Singapore stays multicultural and we retain this unique strength of our society.
I have one last subject. It's very late, but I think I will talk about it all the same and this is babies. It's a very serious problem for us and for all the developed countries. Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Europe. Even the Catholic countries in Europe, Italy has a very low fertility rate, Spain too. The only exception is America where immigration is very high and somehow, the culture is completely different. It's a national problem for us, but it's also an intensely personal business. I asked when did previous Prime Ministers raise such delicate matters? My people tell me, Mr Lee raised it in his 18th National Day Rally. What about Goh Chok Tong? He waited for his tenth National Day Rally. This is my first one. So, new baby, please be understanding.
Our approach is, let's put it like this -- this is a matter of values, not of incentives. It's values and priorities, not the financial grants and subsidies, which count. We want people to have babies because you want them and you love them. It's part of a happy family life. It's fulfilling to bring up a child. You can have the most successful career, you can be the richest man on Earth or the most powerful man or woman on Earth, but if you don't have a family and don't have children, I think you're missing something. It starts off with missing changing nappies when you have a child, but then you miss watching a child learning to walk, learning to talk, going to school, getting sick, depending on you, walking with you, playing with you. You are teaching him, doing homework with him or her. Then you'll find that he's got his own temperament, character, personality, he’s different from you. He's got his own ideas and after a while, one day, you are helping him or her do homework and he says, ""No, no, you do it like this"" and I look puzzled and I don't quite know what he is talking about, but he does and you know he's taken a step forward and he's on his own. And then they grow up a bit more and you have to, come a time when they ring up and say, ""Can you pick me up at the cineplex?"" Then you will worry whether they have found girlfriends or boyfriends. Then you will worry if they have not found girlfriends or boyfriends and you will think by the time they are 20 years old, they would have grown up, but actually, even when they are 50 years old, if I'm still around, I will still be fussing. ""Drink your pao shen"" (泡参ginseng), take care of yourself, don't overstrain because my parents do that and I think if I'm still compos mentis, I will do that too.
So, these are not things you can translate into dollars and cents, or careers and promotions. It's fulfilling. It's sad if you don't have it. We wish every Singaporean do and have a couple of children, three, if you can. It's difficult, yes, people say quality time, but actually, some of my friends who have three children say ""economies of scale"" because with three of them, they form an ecosystem. They learn from each other, they take care of each other, the older ones look after the small ones, which means they learn. The small ones learn to share with the big ones, which means they also learn and if you only have one and you spend quality time with him and he goes to school and the teacher cannot spend quality time with him, and his friend borrows his eraser, he may punch his friend on the nose. So, have two, three. I won't say have half-a-dozen but have a couple. We are not going to micromanage your lives. I mean, we won't say, have the first one by 25 years old, the second one by 30 years old. It’s up to you. What we can do is we'll make it easier for families to marry and to have children. You make the decisions.
But I think what we have to do is to change attitudes. We've got to change attitudes of the singles, of the couples and also of employers. It’s probably easiest with the employers, you just have to persuade them that they have to be fair to their staff -- parents, mothers who have children, give them time off, give them some flexibility. Women who are pregnant, be fair to them and don't sack them because they are about to have a baby. And if you look at the more successful companies, IBM, Hewlett Packard, the American companies, they are very good employers in this respect. They look after their staff. It's not just the Government. We try to be good employers, but they are doing it for commercial reasons and it makes sense for them because they know if they take care of their staff properly, their staff will be loyal to the company and will perform.
Harder to change is the attitudes of singles. They need to have realistic expectations. Don't look for the impossible. If you go for MCS soap opera standard, then no hope. What do I mean by being realistic? I give you a couple of examples. First one is from a very experienced grassroots leader friend of mine who said he counselled his niece many years ago. She was single in her late 20s. He says, ""You must get a husband"". She said, ""But I must find a man who will tell jokes to me, entertain me, pick me up if I am down, look after me in the evenings"". So, he told her, ""You don't need a husband, you need a TV set"". So, she took his advice to heart, got married and is now happily married with children. I should bring him into SDU (Social Development Unit) council some day.
But I asked SDU, do you have problems of high expectations? They said, ""Yes"". So, I said, ""Give me some examples. Don't give me statistics, just give me some examples"". So, they gave me a couple. One person said he wants a girl, tall, long hair, intelligent, fair, no spectacles, I don't know what other particulars he specified. So, SDU worked very hard, went through the files, produced the girl – tall, long hair, everything, but wore specs. He went out with the girl, came back, says, ""Change"". So, the SDU matchmaker says, ""Why? She’s a perfectly fine lady, why don't you want her? She's wearing specs. Okay, change, she can wear contact lenses"". He said, ""No. If she wears specs, bad genes. Children will wear specs"". So, I asked, what about him? He also wore specs. So, he's still single. Another one says, ""I want a girl, this, that, the other, preferably stay in Bukit Timah"". So, matchmaker found him somebody nice, suitable social background, so on. Problem? She stayed in Bukit Merah. Wrong Bukit.
""So, I think it's not the matchmaker's fault, right? I think we've got to change our mindsets and be realistic and accommodating. I think couples, too, have to change their mindset because we have to share the responsibility more equally and more fairly. In the old days, the man worked, the woman looked after the family. Man brought home the bacon, the woman brought up the kids, and for a lot of homes, they are still like that. If you have done Meet-the-People sessions, you will know. We've seen a lot of women who've been deserted by their husbands, husbands left, not paid maintenance, trying to go to court, come to look for us. But we very seldom see a husband come, deserted by a woman who's not paid him maintenance and needs our help. That's the reality of our society. It's patriarchal, but that's the way it has worked.
So, because of that, we've always said, for government medical benefits, for the man, your wife and children can get. For the woman, husband and children cannot get because husband is supposed to take care of you, not you of your husband. But a lot of women have felt very angry about this. I know Irene feels strongly. I think Indranee, Penny, they are all watching me carefully and the reality is changing. The reality is changing, our society is changing. The women are working, they are going out. Ten years ago, I don't think you could have imagined a women's team wanting to go and climb Mount Everest, but today, there is and I think that if we're going to talk about shared responsibility, if we are going to shift and try and get couples to split more evenly the duties of bearing and bringing up children, I think we should move. So, after many years, after thinking this over many times and picking up the stone and putting it back again and again, we will now decide to equalise medical benefits for men and women under the new medical schemes. The older schemes which are moribund, we will extend it to their children because I think for the older schemes, there are Civil Service complexities, but for the new schemes, let's treat it as equal. So, philosophically, I accept. The private sector is doing it, I am doing it, but make sure your husband looks after you.
I've got a lot of feedback from the public since March when we had the Budget and I said we're studying this and Hng Kiang is chairing a committee and some of these are very sensible feedback on what we should do as our package for procreation. I'd like to read you just one letter which came in the email. I've got the permission from the person. So, let me tell you what she asked for. She said, ""Dear Sir, I am married with a four-year-old son and currently five months-plus pregnant with a pair of twins. We planned to employ a foreign maid to take care of the babies. However, we realised that the maid levy is so much and the maid's salary is so much, excluding her meals"". Then she added up -- full-day childcare and she already has a son, newborn expenses and so on. ""I am writing sincerely to seek your kind assistance. One, maid levy -- we hope to pay a lesser amount of maid levy monthly, if possible. Two, Medisave for hospital bill -- this time round, I plan to have a Caesarean delivery, thus the hospital bill may be slightly higher. I am worried that I may have to fork out a lot of cash on hospital bills. So, I sincerely hope that we can utilise more Medisave so that we do not have to fork out so much cash. Three, maternity leave (feedback only) -- like any other mothers, we feel that eight weeks of maternity leave is quite short. If possible, an additional of four or eight weeks will really be beneficial and valuable to both the mother and the baby. My estimated due date is around beginning of September. I thank you for your precious time in reading my mail, sincerely hope that you can understand my situation. Your kind assistance will be very much appreciated"".
I thought this was a very sensible letter because the things she asked for are, in fact, the things which mothers need – maid, delivery expenses, leave. So, I checked up whether her baby is born. She says, ""Not yet, two weeks more"". So, I will deliver my package before she delivers her baby. I will just sketch out the rough outlines and Lim Hng Kiang will tell you all about it in a few days' time. Childcare – it's a key concern of mothers, both the caring and looking after of their kid when he's young, also the bonding, to form that special tie between mother and baby when the child is growing up. What do you need that will evolve as the infant grows? First few weeks, you need the maternity leave, then you have infant care, then you have childcare, then a little bit older, you still need help around the family. So, for maternity leave, having gone through employers, employees, unions and so on, what we will do is we will extend the leave from eight weeks to 12 weeks – four more weeks. We will go from three children to four children and the Government will reimburse the extra expenses because if we just put it on the employer, I think it's not fair and the employer will say, ""I prefer not to have a woman"".
Infant care – this is a gap in our system. Now, we have childcare subsidies but we don't have infant care subsidies which are commensurate because infant care is a lot more expensive than childcare. You need almost one caregiver for two babies. So, we will introduce a Centre-based Infant Care subsidy similar to the childcare subsidy but higher. I think it's S$400 per month.
Then we'll have childcare leave – this is a new thing, so let me explain what it is. We could have had, say, five weeks more of maternity leave at the beginning when the baby is born, but we decided, let's have four weeks more and keep this extra one week and let's spread it out over, say, the first seven years of the child's life, two days a week. So, that's actually two weeks more, two days a week over seven years. So, if you are a parent, a father or a mother with a child below seven, then every year, you are entitled to two days of childcare leave. We will change the law. Which means if your child is sick, you can do it, if your child needs to see the kindergarten teacher, you can take a day off. You want to take a day off with the child, go to the zoo on a Monday. It can also be done. Two days a year, provided the child is below seven, no matter how many children you have below seven.
Then, maids – a lot of parents have asked for maid levy to be made lighter and I think there’s something in it because one of the ways we can ease the burden for working mothers, or even non-working mothers in Singapore, is to let them have maids, which they can't do in many other countries. If you are living in America, or in Australia, or in Britain, you won't have a maid help you at home. At most, you have a cleaning lady come in once a week or twice a week, but a maid in the home is something that we’re lucky to have in Singapore. But there is a levy and I think it's right if you have a child, we lower the cost. So, we will lower the maid levy for families with children below 12 years old.
Grandparents – grandparents are a tremendous help to families who have children. All the MPs I talked to say so. If they haven't had grandparents, they couldn't have managed, either their own parents or their in-laws. All the grassroots leaders say so. There are even scientific studies of pre-modern societies, Finland and Canada, which showed – they checked all their church records – that if you have a grandmother below 60 living within ten miles, you have two extra surviving grandchildren because the grandmother will help to look after them, will help to guide them, will spot what's wrong and no doubt will nag you to have a few more children. And I can tell you they make a tremendous difference. I have benefited from this. If I did not have my parents or my mother-in-law helping to look after two very young kids in 1984, when Chok Tong asked me to come in, you may feel National Service, you may want to serve, can you do it? But I had the 亲母 (mother-in-law) at home. I had my parents bringing the children out for walks in the evenings. I come home at night, they are asleep, but I know that they have been fed, attended to, disciplined, if necessary. Everything is in hand. And so, I came in, no maid levy discount, no grandparent incentive, but the grandparents made the difference. And I think for many families, it's like that and so, I think we should have some incentives which are targeted towards families which have old folks at home, on tax and also on the maid levy and this, we will do.
Next, financial support – I won't talk a lot about this. We have various tax breaks, all kinds of them. We will improve them and tidy them up. We also have a Baby Bonus which is now for the second and third child. I think we want to spread it out so that we're not just focusing on this specific child. So, what we will do is we will extend it to the first, second, third and fourth children.
Finally, I think we need a better work life balance. Apart from high expectations being the reason why young people don't get married, another reason is they are simply too busy. They are working. If they are lawyers, they may finish at eleven o'clock at night. If they are civil servants working at MTI, maybe ten o'clock at night. No time to go out, socialise, make friends. Married couples also need good work life balance. I think we are working longer hours. I am not sure why, but hours have become longer, the pace is more intense. Maybe it's the Internet, maybe it's email, maybe it's globalisation, but whatever it is, you wake up at six o'clock in the morning, you check your email. Eleven o'clock at night, before you go to sleep, you check it again and next morning, you come back, somebody replied at 2.00 am. How to have children?
The Government has a solution for everything. So, because of this, we have a Family Life Officer in every ministry. So, one ministry had a Family Life Officer who sent out a notice to the whole ministry, circular, email, cc all, saying you must maintain good balanced family life, stay at home, paid holiday, quality life, so forth and she sent it out at 11.00 pm from her office PC. I don't know whether she's been sacked yet, but I think we have to keep a balance. There has to be on-time and off-time. The US has got a good practice, five-day week. They work like mad, Mondays to Fridays. Breakfast meeting, 7.00 am, dinner, post-dinner meeting, 10.00 pm, 11.00 pm. Friday night, work late; Saturday, Sunday sacrosanct, absolute no-no. Never mind who you are, no business. They will save the time for their family, for their community, they do social work. Totally different personality. They coach a basketball team. They work hard, five-day week. Other countries are different. Five-day week, by Thursday afternoon, your weekend is getting close.
We have always resisted a five-day week. I have made this argument many times. When I went into Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), they put up a paper, I said, ""No"". Last year, they were about to put up a paper. Before they could put it up, I had already answered somebody else ""no"" in the newspapers. So, they withdrew their proposal. But, in fact, it is one of the most important things for our young people and when we talk to employees coming in or staff coming in and ask them, ""What is it which you are looking for?"", the first thing they ask us is, ""Do you work on Saturdays?"" because they want that time. Two days of a weekend is different from one-and-a-half days of a weekend. So, after having said, ""No"" for a very long time, I think it is time to turn this stone over also. So, the Civil Service will go to a five-day week. I didn't know you were all civil servants! It will apply also to schools and army camps, but we will not reduce the official working hours. So, whatever it is, 44 hours, you have to do, you cover that during the week. And if the public counter is open on Saturdays, has to be open on Saturdays, we will keep it open on Saturdays. So, five-day week doesn't mean everybody is off on Saturday. Some people may be off on Monday or some other day of the week. Now, I wanted to say that I was going to go to work on Saturday, but the civil servants told me, please don't say that, but I can tell you I would be checking my email on Saturday and I'm sure for the ministers and for the people who are in the political leadership, the weekends will be time for them to spend in the community with the grassroots and keeping in touch with the residents.
So, let me recap. Lim Hng Kiang will announce all the details on Wednesday. You can ask him as well as his committee, which includes several ladies -- I think Amy Khor is on the committee and Lim Hwee Hua – all the tough questions. My job is just to make the speech. This package by itself isn't going to solve the problem, but if it changes Singaporean mindsets towards marriage, family and children and causes people to think again and reorder their priorities in life, then I think it will contribute to turning the situation around.
I haven't been able to cover every segment of society in detail tonight. I read today's Sunday Times – ""What I would like to hear in the National Day Rally?"" Everybody had a wish list and I think everybody has a right to wish for something – the disabled, the disadvantaged, the old, the young, the married couples, newly-married and so on. And when I talked about an inclusive society, I include all of them, but if I cover all of them tonight, you will not go home till midnight. But at the right occasion at the right events over the next few months and years, we will talk about them, we will address them and we will see to their needs because an inclusive society has to embrace all and everybody must have the chance to have a good life and to be part of this Singapore Story.
We are now in Singapore in a region where opportunities abound. It's the most dynamic region in the world. There is no other place where we would prefer to be.
You want to be in Latin America, you have your problems. You want to be in Africa, God help you. But in Southeast Asia and Asia, for all the problems, for all the uncertainties and risks, I think this is a dynamic, exciting, challenging part of the world. Companies in Singapore are benefiting from this. Our local companies are doing well. You look at Mustafa’s, the amount of TV sets and things it sells going to India, and it's expanding. And the multinationals are doing well in Singapore, too. The wafer fabs are doing well. One of them told me a few months ago, he's got a plant in Ang Mo Kio, he says, ""Your Ang Mo Kio plant produces five times as many wafers, discs as all their plants in the whole of Europe"". I was very happy because Ang Mo Kio means Ang Mo Kio GRC, but they are doing well and they are exporting and they are creating jobs for our people.
Our Singapore businesses are going abroad, too. All kinds of businesses are operating around in the immediate region. We've got manufacturing, logistics, real estate, hotels. Our household names are in Malaysia and Indonesia. You want to go to KL, you can get Crystal Jade, or you want to go Indonesia, Jakarta, you can get Crystal Jade, Tung Lok, BreadTalk. In fact, there is a BreadTalk in Shanghai, I opened it, as well as a KopiTiam. You want to go to KL, there's a Zouk (disco), it's quite funky, and many other projects like that.
Our economy is thriving and competitive. We are getting new investments coming in, we are getting investments choosing Singapore overIndia, over China. So, we look at them as competitors, but I think we know that we are able to hold our own and because of our workforce, because of our quality, because of our policies and government, people are prepared to come, invest in Singapore and create jobs and prosperity for us. Not just multinationals. Even Chinese and Indian companies are coming here. So, we've got 1,400 Indian companies, 1,200 Chinese companies inSingapore and EDB is quite confident. They are going full-steam ahead, bringing in new investments and we are quite confident that in 15 years, they can double our manufacturing output. And if EDB tells me that then I think they must have added, they must have kept back a small percentage for themselves. So, I think they will make the target.
And we are having jobs, not just manufacturing jobs, but also in services. Banking is hotting up and because we have private banking and asset management and we have become a financial centre because we opened up, there are many jobs where we don't have the skilled people. Tourism – whether or not we have a casino, I think we will grow it. Transport – SIA and PSA have downsized, but as they grow, after they have restructured, I think they will need staff again over time. And we are getting new sorts of industries, creative industries. You may have seen recently George Yeo opening, at the launch of a project, Lucasfilm. Lucasfilm are the people who made Star Wars with the swords and they're coming here, they're going to produce films, TV serials, games that blend East and West. And it means new jobs, exciting opportunities to create unique entertainment. And they’re very good jobs, jobs which require art, which require technology, IT, mathematics, business, jobs which our people are good at.
If you want to be an animator, a cartoonist, you want to draw a storyline, you want to create special effects, you need brains as well as talent. I visited Weta Works in Wellington in New Zealand last year. They made Lord of the Rings, or they supported the people who made Lord of the Rings and we have some Singaporeans on attachment there, learning the craft. I was very impressed with them. They've got the skills. It's very interesting. In the old days, you draw cartoons one by one, then you colour, then you draw the next one, then you flip over. Now, it's all on a computer. You have a model. So, you have a model of a puppet on a computer, or rather the puppet is the model. So, normally, with a puppet, you hold the strings. Here, with the puppet, you use your mouse, you slide the cursor, the puppet can raise his eyebrows, stick out his tongue, make a face at you or get angry and so, you can give a personality to the puppet. And our people have those creative skills and our polytechnics and our ITEs, it's not just the universities. Nanyang Polytechnic is producing good people who will be in demand for creative industries and we're talking about hundreds initially, later on maybe thousands, but it will make a contribution with good jobs for Singaporeans.
The young ones here will remember and know what is Matrix: Reloaded. It's a movie. I haven't seen it, but I know about it and it's a movie with special effects and you may remember that last year, they were showing it. The smoke and explosions were done by a Singaporean called Nickson Fong. It's a very specialised business. He was a NAFA graduate. He went to Hollywood, he did all this and he was overseas. I met him last year when he came back and he said, ""Well, one day, maybe I will come back, but right now the opportunity is not right, the opportunities are overseas"". So, he went to Taiwan, he started something. But last week, he emailed me, he says, ""I'm now back in Singapore"", with pregnant wife, new baby, came back to Singapore to get born and he's setting up a company, Egg Story Creative Production so as to do this creative technology, IT film production work. So, I think that there are opportunities and if I may borrow a young word, I think ""The Force is with Singapore"".
We are building something unique and precious here. In a world full of strife, we have many races living in harmony. In a region where corruption is everywhere, we have a clean and meritocratic system. We invest in our young to help each one to find his strengths and realise his aspirations. We offer special opportunities to all to do well and also to contribute to Singapore and we spread widely the benefits of progress so that everybody benefits when the country does well. And we are strengthening our national identity day by day. It's not yet a very long history, but year by year, with each crisis, with each joy and each sorrow, we build on it. So, when there is Sars, we bonded, when there's an economic crisis, we shared it, employers, workers, the Government. When we have tragedies like RSS Courageous or the Nicoll Highway collapse, ordinary people rose to the occasion to become heroes of the nation and for those who lost their lives, their memories are etched permanently in our collective memory.
It's what the Chinese say, “歌于斯, 哭于斯, 聚国族于斯” – you weep here, you rejoice here, you gather your clan here. It's not a perfect society. None is. But it's a society where if we have a problem, we can discuss it, we can find some way to resolve it, we can tackle it and if something is wrong, we will put it right. And so, over time, we will make progress. I think we have reason to be confident of our future. Very often, we ask ourselves, how are we going to fix these problems? Whither Singapore? We worry about our weaknesses and, indeed, we've got to tackle the problems which we have. But while we fix our weaknesses, we should not forget our strengths, and they are considerable, and others admire them and are trying to emulate them.
We are making friends with the Vietnamese. They are very keen to link up with us. We have a connectivity proposal. They want to learn from us. They want to learn from our experience, Temasek Holdings and its GLCs (Government-linked companies), the central bank, MAS, how we run the government, how we can open up and keep an orderly society. The Chinese, the cities and the provinces are very keen to learn from us. When first, we went into Suzhou, they were not interested in software. Now, they say, ""The Singapore model, what can we do with it? How can we benefit from this not just in Suzhou but in other cities and other provinces?"".
In India, our standing is high. In January, I went to Bangalore. IT is booming away, they’ve a lot of problems but also great confidence. So, I visited an IT company. They asked me to talk to their crowd. So, they gathered everybody on the rooftop. I went up, gave a five-minute speech, practising for the National Day Rally. Just five minutes. So, I said, ""The region is opening up, opportunities are there, India is opening up. Southeast Asia, Singapore, we offer you opportunities, the world is your oyster"". They nearly gave me a standing ovation. So, if they can be confident of learning from us, there is no reason for us to doubt our ability to stay ahead of them and to keep on moving forward. And the key is to commit ourselves to the task, heart and soul, which is what our athletes in Athens have been doing.
You've been watching the Games. I think you were watching table tennis before we started this evening. Ronald Susilo did well earlier. He beat the World No 1, then he lost in the quarter-finals. Li Jiawei beat the World No 2 in table tennis, but eventually, she lost and finished fourth. I spoke to Jiawei just now after her game. She was a bit down, of course. So, she said, ""Well, I am in the top four. Very sad"". I said, ""There's no reason to be sad. We are proud of you. You've done us well. Yes, you've not got the top prize, but we will keep on trying. We will keep on trying. Sports isn't just medals. It's doing our best, trying, trying again, overcoming setbacks, depending on each other, being part of Team Singapore"". And many of our athletes have made Singapore their home and they've become part of our family and we should welcome them and celebrate them.
We may be small, but we have high hopes and big dreams and so long as we are a little red dot in the middle of Southeast Asia, let people know that we are a people who will keep on trying and never say die. And with this spirit, the future is ours to make.
What do we see as a vision for Singapore? I think this will always be work-in-progress because we will never be satisfied. We always want to move on, do better. But I think ours should be a future of opportunity and promise. We should have a prospering economy, creating good jobs for all and having opportunities for our people to venture and to create new businesses and new openings and new possibilities for ourselves. We should have an honest and capable government with leaders whom Singaporeans trust and can rely on. We should have an open society which is welcoming of talent, which welcomes diverse views, is yet cohesive and has a sense of common purpose. And we should be a community where every citizen counts, where everyone can develop his human potential to the full and everyone participates in building and repairing and upgrading this shared home which is Singapore. So, we have a lot going for us. Let's all work together to realise our dreams and to make this bright future for our people and for Singapore.
Thank you very much, indeed.
We may be small, but we have high hopes and big dreams and so long as we are a little red dot in the middle of Southeast Asia, let people know that we are a people who will keep on trying and never say die.PM Lee Hsien Loong

   singaporewebsite update april",21256,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister highlighted several key areas of development and future plans for the nation. He emphasized the importance of adapting to a changing global landscape, particularly in terms of economic restructuring and embracing technological advancements. The PM discussed the need for Singapore to remain competitive by fostering a skilled workforce and attracting foreign investment, particularly in emerging sectors like creative industries.

Significant attention was given to social policies aimed at improving the quality of life for Singaporeans. The PM announced enhancements to family-friendly policies, including extended maternity leave and subsidies for childcare, aimed at addressing the declining birth rate. He also introduced plans for a more inclusive society that supports every citizen, including the disadvantaged and elderly.

The speech also touched on the importance of maintaining a clean and meritocratic government, and the need for open dialogue and community engagement in governance. The PM reiterated the nation's commitment to multiracial harmony and the continuous effort to strengthen national identity through shared experiences and challenges.

Overall, the speech outlined Singapore's strategic direction focusing on economic resilience, social inclusiveness, and robust governance, aiming to ensure the nation's prosperity and stability in the face of global shifts."
2005,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, 40 years ago, we set out into an uncertain future. We didn’t know what lay ahead but we were determined to survive and to build a better future for ourselves. Today, Singapore is totally different. In four decades, we’ve succeeded beyond anybody’s imagination. Our people live well, our children are well educated, we’re friends with our neighbours, and most important of all, we’re maturing as a nation.
One test of this was when the tsunami hit our neighbours last December. Ordinary Singaporeans responded overwhelmingly in cash, in kind, volunteering to help. Our volunteers with NGOs, our doctors and nurses, our SAF and civil defence servicemen, they carried out rescue and relief operations under very difficult conditions.
There are so many stories which could be told, but I have to choose one to represent all the things we did. In Banda Aceh, the air traffic control tower at the airport was damaged by the earthquake and the tsunami. They needed the airport operational so that relief supplies could fly in. We had a mobile air traffic control tower in Singapore. We disassembled it, packed it into aeroplanes, flew it to Banda Aceh, arrived at 11 o’clock at night, unloaded it, assembled it, made it operational 5am the next morning.
Our response to the tsunami won us respect, as well as friendship. It showed the world that our people and our organisations are outfits that are competent, effective, always ready. It showed that we care for others and would do our best to help when our friends are in need.
And so, when the operation was completed and we left, we left as friends. In Meulaboh where we were busiest, Teo Chee Hean went for the farewell ceremony when the SAF sailed away. Colonel Geerhan who was the Indonesian army commander, who was in Meulaboh and responsible for it, hugged him, three bear hugs. We left behind 16,000 school bags in Meulaboh, in Bandar Aceh, in Phuket, in Sri Lanka for the children so that they can start their lives again, gifts with tags hand-made by our school children. And in Indonesia, every bag carried a little piece, one red and white Indonesian flag, one red and white Singapore flag.
So, I think we have friends as a result of this. It’s a great tribute to the men and women who took part. Your team work and spirit made it possible and you made us all proud to be Singaporeans. Some of you are here tonight. May I ask you to rise and stand and be recognised. We salute you.
Another sign that we are maturing as a country is that I think young Singaporeans now understand what it stands for us to survive as a nation. Two weeks ago, I was here in this cultural centre watching a National Day musical review, “All 4 Love” put on by Lim Swee Say’s grassroots and the GRC, very high quality production but the casts were all volunteers. That’s a National Day production, so National Day stories. As Lim Swee Say said, at the end of the story, his tissue box was empty.
But what registered, what caught my eye was the cast. The youngest member was an 11-year-old girl, primary five, Patty Lim was her name. And they produced a programme book. So I flipped through and I found in the programme book what Patty Lim had said for her birthday wish for Singapore -- “to have a constant supply of water. I also wish for peace in Singapore”. So, I give her and her national education teacher full marks.
As a small country, we pay close attention to making friends abroad and ensuring Singapore’s security. We are on good terms with all the important countries in the region. With our immediate neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia, I have established relationships with their leaders, President Yudhoyono and Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, and we are working together, cooperating in many areas.
We are investing in Malaysia and you see Malaysia is investing in Singapore. They recently bought some shares in I think M1. We’re happy at that.
In ASEAN, we’re growing our linkages on a broad front, talking about an ASEAN community by 2020, hopefully sooner. Beyond that, India, Japan and Australia are good friends with us. In the Middle East, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has been very busy expanding ties, visiting, cultivating them, developing a relationship which we will need for the long term.
And our relations with China are back on track and with EU and America, our relations are good.
So, we are friends with all the key players which matter to us. They are not all friends with one another all of the time, and they have various problems amongst themselves but with Singapore, we are on good terms with them and that’s a comfortable state of affairs to be in.
One security issue which we have to worry about is terrorism. The London bombings remind us all if we needed any reminder, that this threat is real, is live and so, we have to take precautions and do our utmost to prevent anything untoward from happening in Singapore.
So, you see, even for our National Day Rally, we have to go through a long process before we can all sit in here tonight -- policemen, Ghurkhas, roadblocks, sentries, scans -- but it’s necessary. We have to take it with the utmost seriousness because the terrorists have not given up.
But we have to be psychologically prepared. If ever something happens here, we’ve got to remain unshaken, respond promptly, efficiently, calmly and press on as one united people, just like the British did when there were the bombings on the London tube in July.
Most important of all, we must not let the terrorists destroy our hard-won racial and religious harmony and social cohesion, the fabric of our society which we've built up over 40 years. And that’s why the answer to the terrorists is not just security measures and bomb scans, but also nation-building.
What will Singapore be like 40 years from now? I can’t tell you. Nobody can. But I can tell you it must be a totally different Singapore because if it is the same Singapore as it is today, we’re dead. We will be irrelevant, marginalised, the world will be different. You may want to be the same, but you can’t be the same. Therefore, we have to remake Singapore -- our economy, our education system, our mindsets, our city.
I will start with the economy because that’s how we earn a living for ourselves. In fact, last year I wanted to start with the economy, but my ministers told me, everybody knows you make economic speeches, say something else. But I’m coming back to the economy this year because, in fact, that’s the root of how we will solve all our other problems.
Asia is rising, the tide is rising, and we will benefit from this flood tide. It’s far better for us to be in a region where our neighbours are growing and opening up opportunities for us than it is to be in a region where our neighbours are stagnant and we hope to make our living because we are doing a little bit better than them.
I know that many Singaporeans are concerned about competition. It’s understandable because everywhere in the world, people are worried about competition, anxious about livelihoods.
I was in America in July. The economy is doing well, their unemployment is down, hundreds of thousands of jobs are being created every month and yet, the mood is worried, uncertain, anxious and the political leaders are anxious because if people are worried when things are good, what more when things are down?
In Europe, they’re fearful of competition too, not just competition from China or India, even competition within Europe. So the French had a referendum on the European Constitution and it lost, and one of the reasons was they were worried about competition from the Eastern European countries. So the Polish plumber became the icon because it’s a new country, they’re paid less, they work harder, they’re going to cause all Frenchmen to go out of work.
Even in China, as I explained just now in my Chinese speech, people face fierce competition amongst themselves. There are 1,300 million Chinese workers. Lim Swee Say had a good explanation of why people are worried. I will explain it to you, not as good as Swee Say, but I will try. He says this is a ""cheaper and better"" argument. There are countries in the world which are cheaper than us, we’re better than them. There are countries in the world which are better than us, we’re cheaper than them. But now the countries which are better than us are getting cheaper and the countries which are cheaper than us are getting better. It's like the scissors are closing and we are in the middle. And if we don’t jump out and do something, we’re going to be squeezed.
But we’re not going to stay there. We didn’t get here by doing nothing. We started with nothing and we made this. We started with mosquito coils, exporting them. We went on to make semiconductors. We started with bee hoon makers, now we have the Biopolis. So, we have to continue to change and to start ahead of the game and there are two major thrusts that we are going to continue to grow and prosper.
The first is to foster innovation and enterprise and the second is R&D.
Let me talk about innovation and enterprise first.
It’s one strong lesson which I took away after visiting Las Vegas. I spent one night and one day there, didn’t win a cent, didn’t lose a cent, but what I learnt is that out of nothing, in a desert, they’ve built a city -- 40 million people visit there every year. What is it? Imagination, enterprise, drive, organisation. So, you imagine the resort, you imagine what people want. You conceive and put together all the pieces -- the restaurants, the food, the spas, the golf course, the entertainment and, of course, the gambling -- and you present it in a way which people come and enjoy and say, ""This is good. I will tell my friends and I will come back"". And what made it? Innovation and enterprise, the human imagination.
I’m not saying that Singapore wants to become Las Vegas. I think we don’t want to become Las Vegas, but we should learn from that spirit and take what is relevant for us. I think we have some of that. We have home-grown companies which are using their creativity, knowledge and ideas to carve out niches for themselves and new markets for themselves. You’ve heard about the big ones -- Osim, Creative, Hyflux. So, I will tell you one interesting story about small ones, SMEs in an out-of-the way place, East Timor.
Two years ago, DPM Tony Tan visited East Timor. We had SAF soldiers there serving with the UN. So he visited the troops. General Lim Chuan Poh, who was then Chief of Defence Force – he's here somewhere tonight -- accompanied Dr Tony Tan. While he was there, he got a phone call from his former SAF NS driver in the division. So, he asked the driver, ""What are you doing here?"" The driver says, ""I’m doing business here. I heard the UN was here, the foreigners were here, they needed service. I came, selling oil, lubricants, electronic goods, opened a little café in Dili Airport"".
At first he couldn’t speak a word of Bahasa. So, to communicate with his business people, he used a calculator. He'll do the sums to show, do subtractions, additions. But, over time, he learnt Bahasa, picked it up without lessons and now he’s doing okay. He told Lim Chuan Poh, his attitude was ""ga ga zo"", ""just do it"".
He wasn’t the only one. There were about 10 or 20 of them there and they went to the airport to meet Dr Tony Tan. Tony said they did not ask him for anything. But they said: ""Please keep the SAF here a little bit longer because from time to time, there are riots in this place and we need somebody to protect us.”
So, we need innovation and enterprise.
Secondly, we have to exploit R&D, knowledge. We built up this economy based on efficiency, based on cost-effectiveness. We work well, we squeeze costs down, minimise waste and so, we attracted multinationals to come here. They provided the enterprise, we got the jobs.
Now, we have to go beyond efficiency. You must still be efficient, but you must now develop and exploit knowledge, R&D, compete on the basis of knowledge and innovation and talent and not just on costs. And that way we can move the economy to the next level.
I give you an example of three companies to show what I mean – Philips, Samsung and Sony. All three electronics companies. They all started off doing consumer electronics. Philips went for R&D, medical products, sold medical instruments, sophisticated software inside, high margin, high knowledge content.
Samsung is in handphones but fancy handphones, a lot of innovation and design. So, they have colour screens, they have built-in cameras. One new model every few days and they’ve built themselves a big market share and profits.
Sony is in consumer electronics, high volume, low margins. In fact, in recent years, they suffered losses. So, we have to adopt a strategy like Samsung and Philips.
So over the last year I asked Dr Tan to chair a ministerial committee on research and development. They’ve studied it in-depth, visited many countries, made their recommendations and the Government has accepted their recommendations -- two big ones. One is to set up a Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council (RIEC) to advise the Government on research and innovation strategies and to include people from the private sector, from academia, people from the scientific community and also the key ministers to be involved in it so that you can get the lessons first hand. And secondly, to set up a National Research Foundation (NRF) to fund long-term research in strategic areas. We’ve accepted these recommendations. This has to be a national effort, backed by the whole government and with the co-operation of the private sector. So, I’ve decided that for the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council, I will chair it myself. The National Research Foundation, Dr Tony Tan has agreed to chair and he will also be the Deputy Chairman of the RIEC, the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council, and he will help me to drive this effort and continue to do so after he steps down as DPM at the end of this month.
I’m very grateful to Tony because he stayed on to help me through this transition year. He's done major projects, the R&D review, co-ordinating national security, setting up the system for looking after our national security, overseeing university education and now agreeing to contribute after stepping down.
He has many more contributions to make to Singapore. Thank you, Tony.
So, innovation, enterprise and R&D, these are the ways to remake the economy. There are risks in this approach. We are a small country, we can’t bet on every number on the table, we have to back certain positions. But we have to do this and if we succeed, we will gain a competitive edge which will put us ahead for 15 or 20 years to come; not forever, but long enough for us to make a living and to work out the next step forward and, therefore, to create jobs and prosperity for Singaporeans.
When we talk about economic growth, it’s for a social purpose because with growth, we generate resources and with the resources, we can deal with our social objectives, the things we want to do, achieve goals, make progress together.
We can deal with adjusting to a society with older Singaporeans. Last year I spoke about younger Singaporeans. So this year I shall talk about older Singaporeans and their concerns.
We can help low-income Singaporeans to make sure nobody is left out and also, we can make sure that healthcare will be affordable, which I will talk about briefly at the end.
Let me start with the question of providing for the needs of older Singaporeans. We are a society which is rapidly ageing. If you are just within Singapore, you may not notice it because it happens day by day, gradually. But if you are a foreigner and coming here for the first time, the shock is palpable.
Halimah told me, she went on a walkabout one day and in the market, met an Indonesian maid, just arrived in Singapore. The maid said to her, ""Ibu, saya lihat di-Singapura banyak orang tua!"" In other words, ""Ma’am, in Singapore, there are an awful lot of old people"" and in Indonesia, it’s not like that. So, I think we have to adjust. There are many issues which are involved in adjusting to becoming an older society, a silver society, sounds better. But today, I will focus only on one of them and that is on how to get people to work longer. We can’t retire at 55 and then live on till 80 or more. It’s okay if you retire at 55 and you live on for five, 10 years, well, you enjoy your grandchildren, but to work for 30 years of your life and then to cool heels for 25 more years, I think you will go gaga. Cannot be done. You’ll have to work longer. It’s not easy, but the key to changing this is attitude – the workers’ attitude as well as the employers’ attitude.
Let me talk first about the workers’ attitude. The older workers have to learn to adjust, adapt, learn new skills, accept temporary jobs, contract work and go with the world, with what is available and what they are able to do, and I know of many older workers who have made these adjustments and who have, therefore, been able to find jobs and remain productive with the help of enlightened employers. They have a strong determination not to give up. They stay in the job market -- no matter what happens, they will do it.
NTUC Lifestyle magazine recently, a few months ago, had an article about such a worker. Her name is Shirley Lee, she’s 63 years old. She was a clerk, she got retrenched in her 50s. She found another job, she got retrenched again. She is now 63. She has savings, her husband is working, but they have a young son still in JC and they had decided that they want to save money for the son’s education, for his future. So, she said, ""I’m still fit, I can work, I will work"". She tried many jobs, couldn’t find an employer. So, she went and got a certificate in cleaning, became a toilet cleaner, not much pay but she did the job and I quote what she said. She told Lifestyle: “The son asked me why I had to stoop so low and be a toilet cleaner, he wanted me to stop. I told him I see no loss of dignity in being a toilet cleaner. I’m earning my living and I’m not robbing anybody. Anyway, what else will I do at home with him so busy in school studying?”
So, with that sort of attitude, Word, Excel, Spreadsheet, when NTUC Lifestyle published her story, she got 71 job offers. She chose one to work with SAGE, the Singapore Action Group of Elders, because she believed in helping others like her. So, I wish her well. I think we all wish her well.
The employers’ attitude is equally important. The companies have to give older workers a chance. If when the worker rings up they say, ""What’s your age?"" You say, ""Forty-five"", and they say, ""Don’t call me, I’ll call you"". Then, you can’t even start. And some of the companies put up requirements -- spas, front-desk receptionists -- says ""40 or below"". I don’t understand this. If you say ""Spa masseuse, work hard, 40 or below"", I can understand, but front-desk? Here, you want somebody who will be able to look after the customer, to have some maturity, be reliable, loyal, patient, ready to work, experienced and skilled and I think older workers have that.
I think employers should change their mindsets and give older workers a chance. Older workers, sometimes employers tell me, ""Older workers are so slow, I better pay them don’t come to work"". But I don’t think it’s necessarily true. They may need a bit more time to get used to the environment, but they are not slow. You go to a fast food joint, you say, ""Regular Coke, takeaway"" -- if it’s a teenager, he knows what you’re talking about. If it’s somebody my age, I may say, ""You want an economy meal, or you want regular? You want to eat here or you want to go?"" So, he says, ""Regular Coke, takeaway"", but ""lia bo kiu"" (don’t understand). But you go to a coffee shop, you say, ""One kopi-si kosong, one kopi-gao, one teh-o-peng"", no problem, everybody gets exactly the drink which he ordered. So, I think older workers can do it.
There are some good employers, but we need more. SGH is one good employer. They’ve got 77 people whom they have re-employed after reaching retirement age. Three of them are reaching 70. How do I know? I asked them. Why did I ask them? Because I met one of these, Mr Ng Hon Weng, he’s a radiographer. That means he sets you up to take x-ray pictures. So, whenever I go to SGH, very often, if he’s on duty, he will do me. Very efficient, puts me up, he says, ""Hands up, shift a bit, hold your breath"", zap, it’s done. X-ray comes out, no re-shoot. I did this once overseas in a very well-known hospital -- young man came, he put me on the table, he shifted the table, he moved me up, he moved me down, he turned me around a little bit. Then his supervisor came, says, ""No good, do again"". So, that’s why Mr Ng, aged 70, is still able to be working, productive, with skills which he can impart to younger people so that they also can be as good as he is and maybe even better in time and I think we need more people working like that and more people willing to employ workers like that.
We’ve got a tripartite committee working on this problem. We’ve got the Workforce Development Agency, the unions, the CDCs, they’re all working closer to help older workers, but I think this is something which is not just policies and formulas and incentives, but mindset change and that’s why it’s National Day Rally subject.
The other issue, the second issue I want to talk about on social issues is low-income Singaporeans, giving them a helping hand. The recent years have been hard for the low income group -- uncertainty, retrenchments, bonuses down, overtime down. Now, the economy is picking up and I can see that the wages are going up, recruitment is going up, things are looking up again. But we still have to pay attention to this problem because I think it has not totally gone away and we must make sure that everybody enjoys the fruits of progress. And also, we have to do this to make sure that there’s social mobility, that whether you’re rich or poor, you have a fair chance of getting your children to do well and to move up in life.      We’ve done a lot to help already. We’ve got all kinds of assistance schemes, like Comcare, particularly this year, which is a big project. We’ve got job redesign and re-creation, so that people can work smarter, be more productive, therefore earn more, whether you’re cleaning tables, whether you’re sweeping the roads, even driving buses.
And we focus on education and training to raise earning power and to make sure that in the long term, we no longer have people who are low-skilled and, therefore, low-pay. I’ll talk about this some more later on.
But the basic principle which we apply in helping low-income Singaporeans, which has worked well for us and, we must keep it, is we go for ""workfare"", not welfare. That means, if you work, if you’re prepared to help yourself, if you’re going to strive, I will help you to succeed. But if you sit back and you say, ""Please do something for me and the more you do for me, the less I need to do for myself"", then I think we cannot do that, because that way is perdition, is a disaster for the individual, he’s demoralised. It’s disaster for the country. Instead of going to create wealth, you’re sitting back and expecting it to fall from heaven. Cannot be done.
I would like to highlight just two areas concerning low-income families tonight. One is the question of dysfunctional families. This is the group which has multiple problems. We see them in MPS. They come, one case, five or six letters to write because they are in difficulty with so many different agencies and actually, even in their own families -- broken up, children misbehaving and so on. All races are represented, but amongst the groups, the Malay community is over-represented, which is why I talked a little bit more about this in my Malay speech just now. But it’s a problem which we have to address, tackle and to help these people get their lives in order, most important, to get their children to be sorted out so their children start off straight in life and don’t go wrong at a young age and then perpetuate the problem in the next generation. So, that’s one of the issues we have to be concerned with.
The other issue concerning low-income families is to discuss what we can do to work to build up their assets. One of the very effective approaches which this government has implemented over many years is the HDB Home Ownership Scheme. We subsidise people to own and to save, but we don’t subsidise people to spend. So, HDB home ownership through helping you to have an HDB flat, we have helped make sure that everybody has a stake in Singapore and it’s a very, very good way to level up our society.
So, we collect all kinds of statistics in Singapore. One of the groups we look very carefully at is the bottom one-fifth of the population, 20 per cent. We’ve published some stats recently about their incomes which have not risen as much as we like. So, I have asked for more study of their wealth, what do they own, and you’ll be surprised, in the bottom one-fifth of the population, nearly all of them own houses, first of all. Secondly, if you take the value of the house, their equity in it, which means how much money, how much is that value for them, on average, they have $138,000. That means the value of the house, you subtract the mortgage not paid, but this is what is worth to him. So, it’s not bad for the bottom one-fifth to have $138,000 of wealth in an HDB house.
It will see him into his old age and his family if he is prudent. Also, they have money in the CPF. So, I asked, ""What about the CPF? Let’s look at this group and see what they have there"".
Well, they have something there. CPF $33,000; Medisave $16,000 average, so you add up, this group has got about $49,000, nearly $50,000 savings for the future. So, I think that we have done the right thing to help provide for this group of low-income Singaporeans to make sure that their future is assured, that they have a stake in Singapore and their old age would be, to a considerable extent, taken care of.
But I think we can do more to help them, not to spend but to build up their assets. We’ve been studying this and we’ve decided that what we’re going to do is to have a new scheme, a new CPF Housing Grant Scheme for lower income families who buy HDB flats. Let me explain to you how this works.
When you buy a HDB flat from the HDB, you get a good price. I think everybody knows that, right? Because we give it to you at below the market rate, it’s a discount, it’s meant as a hongbao. But the discount, the price is the same once you buy the flat, whether you are $8,000 household income, whether you are $1,000 household income, it’s the same price, same subsidy, same bite of the cherry. So, my question is, can’t we find a way to help the lower income groups bite from a bigger cherry? I think there’s a way to do it.
What you can do is when a family buys a HDB flat, we’ll assess your income and if your income is in the lower income group, then I think we can put a grant, paid into your CPF, which will help you to buy the HDB flat from us. This is for HDB flat from the Government and also HDB flat if you want to buy resale, you get the resale grant and I will give you this grant as well. So, in effect, if you’re lower income, you have more and I think if we do this, we would be able to narrow the gap between the lower income and the people who are doing better off.       The details, we have to work out because you want to make sure that people don’t just stop working to get the grant, but we will find a way to do it. I think it’s the right way to do, it’s the right way to help lower-income Singaporeans. So, I’ve told Ng Eng Hen. He says, yes, he’s going to work hard on this.
Last, I’d like to talk about healthcare costs. This is a big subject. If I make a lecture on this, we will spend a long time. So, I will find another occasion to speak fully on this subject but tonight, I just want to say a few of the things which we are doing in healthcare. It’s a concern for many Singaporeans, especially the older Singaporeans and the lower income Singaporeans. So, there are two things which we will do. One, the MediShield age limit. Right now, it’s 80. We will raise it to 85 so that when you are old, when you need the insurance, the MediShield will be there, you will be protected.
Secondly, the Medisave, we will make it more flexible so that for those people who have enough balances and are still working, then we can be more liberal in the withdrawal rules for the Medisave. If you are going to unsubsidised wards, A or B1 wards, or private hospitals, you can have a little bit more out of the Medisave balance and if you go for the SOCs, Specialist Outpatient Clinics, for major treatments, I think we can allow controlled use from Medisave also. I think this will be a great help because even reading the wish lists of people saying what they would expect to hear from the National Day Rally, this was one of them. So, we are working on this. I think we can improve our MediShield, Medisave schemes to make it work better.
These are problems which do not have easy solutions, but I can make you this promise -- we are one people together. Growth and prosperity in Singapore is for all Singaporeans to share and provided you work hard and you help yourself, we will help you to succeed and we will progress together and we will not leave anybody behind.
Next, I want to talk about education because in order to remake the economy, then Singaporeans have to be equipped with the right skills and the right attitudes. Last year, I spoke about the schools, ""Teach less, learn more"", to give our young more room to discover their passionate interests. I think it has caused the schools to think in a different way and considerable progress has been made in this direction. So, this year, I am going to focus on post-secondary education, especially the polys and the ITEs.
We must have an education system which offers first-class education to all and not just to an elite few at the top. We want to create opportunities for all of our people, regardless of their family background. We want to develop every talent, not just those who are academically-inclined, and we want to prevent the problem of low skills and low incomes from going on into the next generation. And that's the way we can keep ourselves an inclusive and a mobile society because if you start at the bottom with a good education and talent, we can move up.
That's why Singapore works. It's not just because we have a few stars but a strong Singapore team. That's why the tsunami operation was possible. You can have the best generals writing orders, but unless you've got the volunteers, you've got the specialists, you have got the technicians, you have got the crew men, the sailors, the men on the ground, an excellent organisation from top to bottom, you cannot deliver. Everyone has to be well-trained, know his job.
In medical care, it's the same. Why is our medical care good in Singapore? Because it's not just the doctors and the surgeons, but the nurses, the technicians, the lab specialists, the whole hospital staff, the administration. So, when you on to the hospital, you can be sure you're in good hands. After your heart bypass, if you have one, your nurse will make sure that you're okay and you wouldn't get an infection and then conk out because of the infection instead of the heart bypass. Or if you have a blood transfusion, you can be sure it's safe. You wouldn't end up with bigger problems from a blood transfusion.
Other countries in the region are going for medical care and they have doctors who are as qualified as ours, trained in the same Western institutions in America and Europe as ours. But the whole package, they are improving, but they haven't got there yet.
I was in one country in the region recently and talking to the diplomats. So, they were telling me the operation cost one-half the price in Singapore. So, I decided to ask him, “Where do the diplomats go?” They said, ""Singapore, Hongkong or Bangkok"". I said, ""What will you do if you are sick?"" So, the wife said, ""I am going straight home to Singapore"". So, that is the difference between a star and a team and we want the team.
So, that means we need good polys, good ITEs and not just good universities. The polys take the biggest segment of our cohort -- 40 per cent of our students go to poly. They are really already world-class, greatly-admired internationally and I went to visit one of them. I went to Nanyang Poly. I was very impressed. They are close to industry, they can respond to industry needs as the needs change and they provide practical and useful training to the students. So, as a result, the graduates are in great demand, very well-paid and skilled.
In Nanyang Poly, I saw two things. One was the Engineering side. They make robots. Not just robots which can wave their hands around and show that it's alive, but robots for a particular operational use, commissioned by the industry. They showed me one which Hewlett Packard had asked them to make. It is a robot to build plotters. A plotter is a big thing which architects and other people use to draw big pictures and you want a robot on a production line. So, you want a real project. The lecturer takes the project, the students work with him, batches of students work with him. This is a real-life project which is going to put to use.
In digital animation, they create their own cartoon. If you see ""Gan Cheong King"" on TV Mobile, that's done by Nanyang Poly. Very good, and I asked them to do a little job for me which you will see later on. Two of their students -- one is Viridis Liew, the other one Min Ming -- went to a World Skills Competition in Helsinki in Finland. Seven hundred students participated from 39 countries. Both of them were top in their class. Viridis was in ITPC Network Support. It's a guy's business, but this is a girl from Singapore and she won first prize. The boy, Min Ming, won in the Software Applications category and if you take the whole competition, out of the 700 people, Viridis was number one, Min Ming was number two, best of best.
The other polys are also creating their own industry niches. So, Temasek Poly has courses in hospitality, tourism management. They do it in Sentosa, preparing for the IRs before we had decided on the IRs. Luckily for them, we said, ""yes"". Ngee Ann Poly, early childhood education, mass communications, film, sound and video, also very good.
How can we improve the polys further? I have a few ideas. I don't think we should make them into universities because if they start awarding their own degrees instead of diplomas, the character of the institution changes and it works differently. You start pursuing paper rather than applications, use practical results, and that's a mistake which quite a number of countries have made.
But what we can do is to make easier for some of the students in poly to get a degree. How? By linking up the poly with specialised foreign universities to run degree programmes in niche areas. So, you can produce graduates in particular applied disciplines, different from what NUS or NTU or SMU is doing. So, it's not a poor cousin of NUS, NTU or SMU, but graduates in specific areas which are in demand. So, for example, if you are into interactive media, you can link with institutions in the US like the Digipen Institute. They award degrees. If you are in resort management, you can get a degree, too. In Hawaii, in Las Vegas, there are universities and if you have a degree, you are in great demand. If you are in cooking, culinary arts, childcare, nursing, then there are top colleges in the US and Europe and you can link up with them, too. So, I think that we can make the polys even better than they are already are.
We can also improve our ITEs, Institutes of Technical Education. This is a brand of education which is unique in the world. Their tagline is ""Thinking Hands"". You think about it. It's a very good slogan because with hands, you are doing something, but the brain behind it, it knows what to do. Smart. So, when they train, they are training people to be hands-on, minds-on and hearts-on. So, you develop a complete rounded person.
I visited them, too. I went to ITE MacPherson. I saw their facilities, the students working on their projects, all very enthusiastic. The students, the staff, very dedicated, self-confident, preparing to lead fulfilling lives. So, I asked them, ""Where do you get your students?"" He says, well, they come from the Normal streams, many of them, academic and technical, half come from the technical stream and three-quarters of the students complete and graduate and go on and find jobs.
Recently four young girls from the ITE participated in a women's competition. It's the IBM Women's Conference Student Contest in Singapore. Four of them, one is a student council vice-president, one is a budding entrepreneur, she wants to sell gift hampers and flower bouquets, one is a teacher in MINDS, one is a national hockey player. They competed against university and poly teams in this IBM competition and they came home with the championship.
I watched a little video which they prepared. It's very interesting. I just quote you one bit from Hemalatha Arudas, who is the hockey player. She aspires to be a hockey coach one day and she says, ""Never say die, try until you succeed. When there's a will, there's a way. If you strive hard and work consistently, you will be able to excel."" And I think she will excel.
So, I think we should take the ITE to the next level — One System, Three Colleges. Simei is one of the colleges which we have built, a big one, consolidated. We are going to build another one in Chua Chu Kang. We are building one in Ang Mo Kio — each one with a critical mass of students, 5,000 or 7,000 pupils, comprehensive facilities and activities, just like the polys and offering more choices to the students. So, you can be academic, you can be CCA, you can take a whole range and go where your spirit wants you to go.
So, what can we do to make sure that the post-secondary education works best? There is one more idea. I think it's worth considering. This arose because I asked the lecturers I met at the polys and ITE, ""Do your students have financial problems"" because, in fact, we subsidise them 90-95 per cent of the costs of their education. They said, ""Well, it's not much, it's a few hundred dollars, but there are some students who still have problems and we raise money to help them because otherwise, they can't afford it and may drop out"".
So, I think we should think of a way to make a Post-Secondary Education Account for every child. So, every student can then draw on this account, go to poly, ITE or university in Singapore. How do we do this? We have the Baby Bonus, quite a lot of money. Not everybody spends it. By the time you get to school, aged six, you are already on Edusave, so you are provided for. So, one idea is when you reach school age, we convert this baby bonus money into a Post-Secondary Education Account and we let parents continue to contribute and we match until the child reaches 18. Actually, he's a big baby by then, but parents are still responsible. When he reaches 18, we can make sure, or 16, we can make sure he gets into a good post-secondary institution in Singapore. And that way, we can help each family to invest in the best education that their children can get, which is the best investment they can make.
What else can we do? I think we can look one level down, below the polys and the ITEs to their intake. The Normal stream for the ITEs.
I asked Tharman, “Do ITE students enjoy ITE? Do they enjoy school? Is it the same?” He said not the same. And I asked the students too. The students say ITE much better — hands on, interesting, they have the choice of different uniforms to wear but can we make the school better so that in the school we apply some of lessons from the success of the ITEs? I think it can be done.
In Normal (Academic), we have already made this curriculum more flexible, giving the students more choices, they can take some O Level courses, they can develop at their own pace. Now, we should do it to the Normal (Technical) curriculum. What can we do? I think first, they still have to learn the basics — English and Maths — but we can do it in a more practical way with group work, hands-on work, more use of IT so that the learning becomes more engaging.
So for example in Clementi, to teach Maths, instead of doing sums, Clementi Town Secondary School, the students work in groups to plan their dream holiday. So you have got to look at newspaper advertisements, look at Internet websites, figure out discounts, work out the sums, airfares, work out the sums, compare the best options; exchange rates; arrival and departure times; collect data, make sense of them and use them. I have not yet asked them whether the first prize they get is the real holiday or not but I think this is a realistic lesson to show how Maths is useful in daily life and the way they are going to use the skills.
So, that's one thing they can do. The other thing they can do is to have practical electives so that you can develop different interests and talents for the kids. Like digital art using software to create digital animations and graphics. Or another very interesting one. They use natural products to try to make medicines and perfume. So you understand health science, you understand a bit of chemistry, you understand a bit of biology. You are doing something which is challenging, interesting, which will keep them engaged, which is half the battle to keeping the Normal Technical students with you because if you talk to the teachers who teach NT classes, they will tell you that a lot of those time is spent counselling them, making sure they are motivated. So with this, we can do it.
We have already got 39 schools with electives. We are going to roll it out under the New Normal Technical Curriculum within the next two years. So we are focusing all the way down across the broad range of the education system to provide many avenues to suit many different students. We want many different models of success like the ITE girls I talked about, showed you, so that you are all not looking to succeed in the same mould but what is your ambition, what are you good at, we will help you to be good at that. And many paths to success and many opportunities to cross over. So you can start in school, you may go to the ITE, you can come back to the poly, you can go from that if you do well, onto university, or to work, or to a professional degree. And many second chances to do well because if you flunk out for some reason but you make good later, we want you back.
I met one lecturer at ITE. His name is Eric Chen. He was expelled from school at Sec 3 for playing truant. So then he didn't have confidence to do O levels. He went to the ITE. It turned his life around. From ITE, he went to Ngee Ann Poly. Then he went to University of Edinburgh, got an engineering degree. Then he went to Imperial College, London, got a master's degree. They offered him a PhD place. He said: “No, I'm going back.” Now he is teaching in ITE MacPherson. I think that is a good role model for many young Singaporeans. Not to flunk out but to do well.
So, we are aiming for a mountain range, not a pinnacle. We want many routes up, many ways to succeed. If you are a teh tarik man, you must be a good teh tarik man. Pour the tea and turn around. Not so easy. Then we will have Singapore the way we wanted to be, with everybody with a place in it. In Chinese, they say 'hang hang chu zhuang yuan' (行行出状元). In every profession, there are the people who are excellent, who are outstanding, who are world-class and I think we must be like that in Singapore.
Remaking Singapore includes remaking our mindsets. We have to change our thinking. There are many mindset changes which we need and which from time to time, ministers make speeches about, not being afraid to fail, being willing to try new things, giving people a second chance, adapting to a changing job market and so on and so forth. Tonight, I only want to talk about one of them and that is to improve our service culture.
It's a critical success factor, if we are going to develop a service industry and it's another thing which I picked up visiting Las Vegas. I met Steve Wynn who owns Wynn Resorts and built several of the other resorts in Las Vegas and they are at the top end. He told me, “The key to the success of a resort is not just the building, the finishes, but the people because the guests come to enjoy and they want a good experience. They want to be looked after, they want staff who will take care of them and you have to train the staff, you have to motivate the staff, you have to reward them. You give them shares, you give Creative recognition, you have human resource systems, you compete to make sure your HR system is outstanding and then you can provide the good service.” The other resort operators also told me the same.
So, we have to be able to do that. In Singapore, we don't have a natural service culture.
If you compare us with other countries, you go to Thailand, for example, whether it's a man or woman, the man will say Sawadikup or the woman will say the Sawadika. You go to Japanese restaurant, Irrashaimasse. Or you go to India, they say Nemeste or Varnakam. You go to Australia, they say Good Day mate! In Singapore, they go straight to the point. “How can I help you?” Or if you're not so lucky, “What you want?""
There are some Singapore organisations which do have excellent service standards -– at Changi Airport, the immigration people are very good, SIA good service. Hotel, retail, food and beverages, they have good service too.
But we have a long way to go to reach world class and I hear of companies that don't really care very much about service quality. This is the problem which has to be dealt with at three levels. One, the companies have to have that focus. Two, the service people have to have that focus. Three, we who are served by the people have to have that culture too.
I will give an example for each of these. Start with the company because they set the tone. There is one poly student who went to do a work attachment in a hotel. It's her final year. So, guest ordered a cold drink, waiting for a friend, felt cold. So this poly student says, I must look after the guest, served her warm water. Got scolded: ""You must not serve her warm water, you must sell her a warm drink."" So she gave up. She said: ""I am fed up with this. I am off.""
If I were her, I would straight away work for the competitor company. But obviously, the hotel operator didn't have the sense. But sometimes it's a service girl or boy or old person who doesn't have it. So there are many horror stories of bad service staff. I asked for some examples. WDA gave me fat file. So I decided to make a training video. I will show you this video now. It's called ""Tao Gay Not Enough"". (Playback of video)
Customer: ""Auntie, two packets, less oil, no chilli, no hum.""Hawker: (In Hokkien) ""Neng bao, you jiou, mai hiam, mai hum""Customer: ""Auntie, sorry, tao gay more.""Hawker: ""Two packets, less oil, no chilli, no hum, more tao gay.""Cook: (In Mandarin) ""Tao gay 要多少?""Hawker: ""Hwey, tao gay how many?""Customer: ""More, please.""Hawker: (In Hokkien) ""Zuei.""Hawker: ""Hello Miss, tao gay enough or not?""Customer: ""Ya.""Indian customer: ""Three packets, thank you.""Hawker: ""Wait.""
But sometimes, the shoe is on the other foot. So I got another video to show you. This one is called ""Tao Gay Never Enough"". (Playback of video)
Customer: (on handphone) ""One packet.""Hawker: ""One packet.""Indian customer: ""Auntie""Customer: ""Less oil, no chilli.""Indian customer: ""Auntie.""Customer: ""More tao gay.""Indian customer: ""Two packets.""Customer 2 (jumping queue): ""Can tomgpang three packets?""Customer: ""Auntie, three more packets.""Indian customer: ""Your friend should join the queue.""Customer: ""Not your business.""(Hawker, looking apologetic, hands one packet of fried kway teow to Customer. Customer refuses to take and stomps off with Customer 2.)
If you enjoy the video, I should say it was made by Ngee Ann Polytechnic, School of Film and Media. So, all three, whether it’s the company, the service staff or the customers, all three have a role to play.
The companies have to show leadership. You have got to adopt service-friendly policies. You must have the system, the process. You must make it possible for your people to give good service. Like Raffles Hotel, the tagline is At Your Service. So whatever you ask for, at your service, it will be done.
And I think we can do that. In our hospitals, some of the hospitals, they use SMS to call patients when their queue number is up. So you can go around, wander the shops, go somewhere else, come back in time and not miss your number. I think that improves the service quality. You have got to emphasise service training for workers, not just the frontline staff, but the managers and the senior bosses as well so that everybody knows that service is important.
So you see, organisations like Housing Board who deal with hundreds of thousands of transactions every year, their senior staff, once a year on Service Quality Day, come down, go to the frontline, serve residents coming who have problems to deal with. So I have heard that. I said, that's good, that’s like MPs doing Meet-the-People sessions.
Then everybody will know service is important, then the frontline staff will get the emphasis and the backing which they need.
Next, of course, the service staff have to acquire a service mindset. You have to know that and believe that service jobs are honourable. These are not low-class jobs. You can serve with pride and professionalism and these are jobs which lead on to something. So Ritz Carlton says, ""Ladies and Gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen”. So you go on and you may begin as a hotel serving girl, you may go on to become a masseuse or if you are a hair dressing assistant, you might go on to run your own salon, become a hair stylist.
There is a career path up. You start by serving. You learn how to please people. You can move on and that's a valuable skill.
But, of course, you need social skills too - how to carry yourself, how to serve, how to be graceful and, therefore, make people happy.
One of the difficulties of doing this is that in Singapore, may be life is a little bit too easy. Why do I say that? I just give you one example.
A Singaporean air hostess arrived at a destination found that she had no passport. A commotion, the airport manager came, sorted the problem out, managed to get her admitted, scolded her, say “Where is your passport? How can you as an air hostess not do this?"" She says, “I must go home and scold my maid because my maid packs my bag, my maid forgot to pack my passport, it's my maid's fault.""
So I think it's a little bit harder to provide good service if you are used to being looked after. But if you look at the wealthy developed countries like America, you can get good service in the restaurants and good waiters. So, I think we can do it provided we put ourselves to it and pay attention and improve. And we have to reinforce this message, reminders, campaigns, all ways.
In Hongkong, they have turned things around. One of the things they did was to have a campaign. So Andy Lau appears on TV commercials to urge people to provide good service. The programme is called 'A Hospitable Hongkong'.
I think we should consider a similar campaign. Maybe we can have Taufik and Sly to do it, and we can have a GST campaign — Greet, Smile and Thank and we will make a difference.
But the customer’s attitude has also to change because if the customer treats you like dirt, you are not going to serve with pride. And customers have to know as the actor in Tao Gay Never Enough didn't know, that just because the person is serving you, it doesn't mean he or she is a slave or a servant. She’s looking after you, it's your responsibility to be courteous, to be considerate, to thank her and to appreciate what he or she has done for you. Good customers get good service. And that I think is something which all of us have perhaps to change. It's easier to say the serving people have to change because we all laugh at the serving people. But I notice Tao Gay Not Enough got more laughter than Tao Gay Never Enough. But Tao Gay Never Enough also must be fixed.
We have put on good shows before. When there's a big event, we do well. The IOC we did very well, and there are other bigger events coming. Next year, there will be the IMF and World Bank Conference, 16,000 participants. That may be ten times the size of the International Olympic Committee Meeting earlier this year and we have to deliver the best service level so that the whole world knows Singapore is not just clean and safe but also welcoming and hospitable. So let's gear up now.
This is an effort which we have to continue for a long time. The government agencies will get together and will promote it and I have asked Raymond Lim to be in charge of this, to make sure that we get everybody together. I think he can do that. It's not just for the tourists but it's also for ourselves because it's the kind of society we are. What we are, being gracious, courteous, respectful of one another, knowing that everybody has a place, a dignified place in Singapore, everybody belongs, doing his part and excelling in his profession and serving with pride.
To remake the economy and attract talent, we have also got to remake our city. This has to be a city which is full of life and energy and excitement, a place where people want to live, work and play, where they are stimulated to be active, to be creative and to enjoy life. MND and URA briefed me recently on their plans. I wanted to know what they were doing and they gave me a full explanation, brought the whole team. The enthusiasm and excitement was infectious. So I decided to come and share it with you and to help me do that, I have prepared some slides to show you.
Every major city in the world is inventing itself and reinventing itself. New York is the Big Apple, but World Trade Centre has collapsed, it has become Ground Zero. They are rebuilding the World Trade Centre, seven new iconic buildings, bringing the life and activity back to that part of Manhattan. And this is what it will look like with the tallest building called the Freedom Tower.
Dubai, building the tallest building in the world, 700metres tall, Burj Dubai, more or less. The top is a bit blur because they wouldn't tell you whether it's exactly 700 metres or not. They don't want somebody to build 701 metres tall. But they are going to have the biggest shopping mall in the world which we have a little part of because a Singapore firm is designing it, DP Architects which was involved in the Esplanade. And they are doing other things too. We have the Biopolis. They are going to go one better. They are going to have one called the Dubai-opolis.
And they say, “We have left Singapore behind.” Now, I am not sure they have left Singapore behind but I think we also have to move.
We shouldn't compete for the biggest, tallest, fanciest, most opulent because we don't have oil and gas. But we must capitalise on our strengths. And what are they? Our multicultural heritage, our clean and safe environment, our disciplined and energetic people, a cosmopolitan and open society, and then we can make Singapore a vibrant global city, not just for tourists but for our own people to create an outstanding living environment for all Singaporeans.
We will start with the HDB estates because this is where our people live and where we want to keep the living environment first-class and up-to-date. We’re renewing the HDB estates one by one. This one is Toa Payoh where we are starting. It’s the oldest comprehensive town but now one of the most up to date, totally transformed. Nearly all the flats have been upgraded, IUP, MUP, LUP, SERS, low rise with lifts, you name it, they have it.
We are building new flats, 40-storey flats with million dollar views which people have moved in, very happy, new population.
There’s a new town centre, bus and MRT interchange, air con, HDB Hub is there, new shops, offices, restaurants. It’s a very successful rejuvenation. Even my own grassroots, Teck Ghee Community Centre, we organise a big National Street Soccer Tournament every year. And the finals of the tournament, instead of doing it in Teck Ghee or Ang Mo Kio, we go to HDB Hub because there’s a natural crowd there. On weekends, 100,000 people visit the town centre and lots of street life activity because there’s a younger population, new flats, young couples have moved in. So property values have gone up. And other towns will also follow.
I asked Mah Bow Tan when is my turn. He says oldest first. ABC, Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Clementi. But others will come too and eventually we are going to do all the new towns in Singapore, provided they support these programmes.
In the city centre, we will rejuvenate Orchard Road. It’s one our premier shopping districts, brand name, known all over the world but it’s facing competition from shopping districts in other cities, Nanjing Lu in Shanghai is very swanky, so we’ve got to rejuvenate Orchard Road.
We’ve already done some things, we’ve opened up. You’ve now got people, food, cafes on the sidewalks. We’ve got the malls opened up, so from the street you can see what’s going on. From inside you can watch the passing crowd.
We have vibrant street life -— dances, drummers, entertainers. But we can do more. We’ll get the owners of the malls to do more and if you look at the beginning of Orchard Road right at the top of Orchard Road, there’s a vacant picnic site over the Orchard MRT Station which is very popular but I think it’s a prime site and we’d like somebody to develop it, a new focal point with space for events and an observation tower. And we’ll make Orchard Road one of the great streets in the world, a place to see and be seen, a place for all to enjoy.
From Orchard Road if you take an MRT the train will soon take you to Bras Bash and Bugis and this is another area which we can do a lot with. I went around it. It’s very interesting what’s happening. We’re transforming it, bringing life back to it, activities, making it very exciting.
The schools are there. The Singapore Management University (SMU Campus) has now gone there. Buildings, gracious, human scale, open, integrated with the trees, blended in with the old historic buildings.
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) is there, lots of students. We are going to have the SIA-LaSalle College of the Arts up next year. They’ll have a very interesting building. We’re building a new art school next to the old Cathay Building and if you put them all together, we’ll have in that area maybe 14,000 students in the city and with student housing which we are building, there’ll be all sorts of activities. Students will hang out in the pubs, cafes, shops, some of them will be in the new National Library where’s there’s a space, using the facilities there.
Not just the books, or the resources or the Internet access which is much better than before but also the Drama Centre, the activity spaces, many events to attract people.
We’ll get the street life back also. Along the streets we have got pedestrian malls now. I strolled along Albert Mall, Waterloo Mall. It’s very interesting, people selling flowers. There’s a Guanyin temple, very popular. Next to that, there’s a Hindu temple, also very popular. I’m told quite a lot of people pray at both just to be doubly sure. Why not? And when you come out, you can rub a laughing Buddha for good luck. In fact, there are two laughing Buddhas for double good luck.
So it’s something new and exciting but also something old and nostalgic about Bras Basah-Bugis area.
Those of you who are my age or thereabouts will remember the old Bras Basah-Bugis area. So many schools there until the 1970s, SJI, which is this one, CHIJ, St Nicholas, St Anthony’s was there, Raffles Girls Primary School was there, even RI was nearby. So was my school, Catholic High School. So the students used to haunt the whole area after and before classes. We used to go to the second hand book shops at Bras Basah Road, all manner of interesting old cheap books and textbooks. We used to go to the hawker stalls along Waterloo Street, teh tarik, ice kachang, the Indian rojak was the best.
Most sentimental of all for many people was the old National Library. We spent hours there studying, chatting, pak tor (courting), made friends, sometimes found partners and many Singaporeans were sad to see it go but unfortunately it couldn’t be helped. So we’ve saved 5,000 bricks and put up a wall in the new National Library to keep the memories alive.
But now we are bringing back the schools, the students and the old atmosphere. If you go by what the students are saying, I think we are succeeding.
I saw an article recently, a letter written by a student in Nafa in the Life! Section which I think is worth reading a little bit of. She’s enjoying it obviously. She says: “There are so many things to do in between breaks. We have numerous choices of food, from prata at Al-Jalani Restaurant, chin chow at Fortune Centre and duck noodles at Sunshine Plaza.” — Siti Aisha Mostafa.
I think we will make this again a lively arts, culture, learning and entertainment centre in the middle of the city. And a new generation of Singaporeans are now forming memories and sentimental links and attachments to the new landscape, just as the older generation did, and it will be one of the things which will anchor Singaporeans and Singapore.
The centrepiece of our redevelopment of the city is Marina Bay. This is a unique site as one of URA’s international advisers says: “There’s no other city in the world that has so much water front, prime real estate right in the heart of the city.”
We’ve got the old civic district which we’ve renovated. We’ve linked it to the new virgin areas, Marina South, Marina Centre, Marina East. We are going to build a new downtown on the new areas, link it up with the old city and extend the city seamlessly into the new Downtown. So there’s water in the bay, there are gardens and we will have a Garden City by the Bay. If you consider Fort Canning behind, in Chinese they say “you shan you shui (有山有水)”, very good feng shui, because there’s mountain, there’s water, and it will be our city.
We start with the water. We will build a Marina Barrage to dam up the mouth of the bay. It will be ready in three years’ time and it will convert the bay into a fresh water lake.
Then we will extend the city around the lake, business, entertainment, recreation. I’ll take you on a tour. We start at the Esplanade. It’s called the Durian but you see in this picture in fact it’s quite beautiful. And the most important thing is not just the performances inside but outside if you walk along the Esplanade you will find lots of life, shops, food, people strolling, people enjoying themselves. It’s like the old Esplanade used to be, only better.
We have the old Supreme Court and City Hall building. We are going to convert it into a new national art gallery and it will have colourful banners hung up.  In case the judges get worried, those banners aren’t there yet. That’s what it will look like when it becomes a national art gallery.
We have the Fullerton Hotel, One Fullerton, the Merlion is there, very successful. If you go to the One Fullerton, lots of things going on and we are going to extend it along the waterfront to Collyer Quay and at Clifford Pier we are going to move out the bumboats and redevelop Clifford Pier and that will be another little jewel.
On Marina South, we have the business and financial centre. This is a big development. When I was in MAS, I had something to do with it because the banking community suggested: why not make one big development like this, then you have the facilities for the financial institutions. You get more banks to do more things here. You have office space you have residential space, hotels.
So we put out a big plot to one developer to make an integrated development. We persuaded URA and the other agencies. They adopted the idea. We’ve had a very successful tender recently and this BFC is going to provide us with first class infrastructure. It’s going to bring in more financial activities and it’s going to be a major landmark on the Bayfront.
Next to the Business and Financial Centre, we will have the Integrated Resort. I don’t know whether it will look like this. This is an artist’s impression but it’s another major project bigger than Suntec or the BFC and it’s going to generate tourists and jobs and also shape the new Downtown and round out the Bayfront.
Then we’re going to have the gardens, more than one garden. One will be next to the IR, colourful flowers like this. One on the other side of the bay in Marina East beside the NTUC golf course and then we will have a third one along Marina Centre, each one with a distinctive design and character and we’re going to connect them together. So you’ll have Marina South, Marina East, Marina Centre. We’ll join them up, link them up with bridges, walkways, promenades so you can walk, you can jog, you can even run a marathon around the Bay. I think that will give us a setting to bring many activities in.
Clark Quay and Boat Quay are already 24-hour zones, all hours of the day and night. But on the water itself in the bay, we can have boating, sailing, racing, dragon boat race here.
So putting all these together, we will make our city really special.We are embarking on the journey now. It will take many years to complete but in five to 10 years’ time, you can see it taking shape. And the Bayfront will be the signature image of Singapore.
And on 9 August 2015, our 50th birthday, it will look like this. That was courtesy of Nanyang Polytechnic.
So the city must reflect the spirit of our people, be well conceived, vigorously executed, restrained but high quality, every aspect thought through, constantly being improved and remade in search of excellence. It will be a city in our image, a sparkling jewel, a home for all of us to be proud of, a home that will belong to all of us.
My theme tonight has been remaking Singapore together, to tap everybody’s contributions, maximise each person’s talents, open up opportunities for all. Each contribution, big or small, is one of many threads that we will weave together, bring together and make the fabric of our nation.
There was a project like this recently. It’s called Today in History Singapore. It’s a book done by MOE but really thousands of students, pupils were involved and it tells the story of Singapore through the eyes of a new young generation.
Take one entry on August 9, this by a young girl. “August 9 is the day our nation got its independence in 1965. Our forefathers struggled to build our nation and to provide us with a bright future. I feel very happy and proud to be born as a National Day baby”. Wong Yun Ting eight years old, Yio Chu Kang Primary School.
The next volume will be Tomorrow in History and that’s for young Singaporeans to write. And young Singaporeans, I expand widely, children, youths, young adults, even adults who are young at heart. You may have grey hair or less hair but if you have that energy, you are part of this story and together we will continue to tell a special Singapore story.
We must never feel constrained by our smallness. You may be a small country but you can do exceptional things. Individually Singaporeans are excelling on the world stage.
I mentioned Viridis and Min Ming just now. I take another example. From sports, we have two of our students. One is Teo Wee Chin from VJC, one is Terence Koh who’s studying overseas in Melbourne. They went to the World Youth Sailing Championship and they became the world youth champions in their class of boats. It’s the first time we’ve ever done this in a sailing competition. In fact it’s the first time any Asian has done this. But we can do it because as Dr Yeo Ning Hong used to say to me: “Sailing is a sport where you depend on brains.”
I think we have outstanding people. I think as a country we can do things better which other peoples can’t. Never believe that anything we can do, others can do better. There are many things which we can do which other people find very hard.
I give you an example. I discussed this with a vice-mayor from Shanghai a few years ago. We were talking about salaries, public service salaries and our system to pay people market rates. He was talking about himself. He says: “I am vice-mayor, I earn the least in my family”. His wife works for a state-owned enterprise, earns more. His daughter works for a commercial bank. I think it’s a foreign bank, earns the most. He said if Shanghai were a country, we could do exactly like you. But Shanghai is part of China. If I do like you, to the north the provinces will complain, to the west the provinces will complain, to the south the provinces will complain, and worst of all, in the centre, Beijing will complain. So bei fang you wen ti, xi mian you wen ti, nan mian you wen ti, zhong yang you wen ti (北方有问题，西面有问题，南面有问题，中央有问题). So it cannot be done. He admired us. He wished he could do the same.
I had an American journalist interview me once after that. He asked me: “What can you do which China cannot do?” I thought if I explained all this to him, it would take too long. So I told him: “I tell you one thing we can do the Chinese cannot do. I can ban chewing gum in Singapore and make it stick. Can you do that in Tiananmen?”
So we must have a never-say-die attitude. Ultimately it’s our resourcefulness and our resolve which counts.
I met Sheikh Alauddin recently. He’s our silat champion, now coach. He’s here somewhere tonight. I asked him: “Who is your toughest competitor in Asia in the SEA Games?” He says Vietnam. I was shocked. I said what does Vietnam knows about silat. Taekwando, gongfu maybe, eastern tradition. But silat? He says yes. They started from zero but they decided to learn in 1993. They got two Indonesian coaches when they started. No building, no gym, no state-of-the-art equipment. They took some metal pipes, tied them together into a frame, put some covering on it, padding, contact sparring, trained hard, tough. After a few years, they were good enough, they sent the coaches home, they were on their own. Now they are champions in Southeast Asia, aiming to be champions in the world. And silat is a top sport in Vietnam.
We have to have the same spirit and I think we have the same spirit. After that, I happened to meet our silat team. I asked them: “Sheikh said this, is it true?”  They said: “Yes it’s true.” I said: “What are you going to do about it?” They said: “Tomorrow we are going to Vietnam to practise with them, friendly tournament.” They’ve come back, I think they’ve done well and I think we all wish them well for the SEA Games in Manila.
You can feel this spirit in the National Day celebrations. Sometimes because we are here too long and get used to it, you become blasé but those who see us from afar, they know how unique and precious Singapore is.
I recently got an email from a German. He was in Singapore. He happened to be around the Padang on the day of our preview. One Singaporean stranger said, “Would you like this ticket, my friend couldn’t come.” He went to watch the preview and he emailed me. Good email, I will just read you a small bit of it. He said “I saw thousands of Singaporeans sitting there, mostly white and red clothes, screaming, shouting and laughing. This parade showed a self-image of a nation I never saw before. The Singaporeans are one people and they are proud to be a part of this people. I received really the impression that Singapore is a nation consisting of its citizens and not a nation with citizens. The pride of being a Singaporean was nearly touchable for me in this stadium! And this all was just in the preview”.
This is a foreign view. I also had a Singaporean view. A Singaporean who’s been away for many years and she wrote to me on National Day to wish me well. She’s Ms Ranjini Thiagarajah, a Singaporean teacher. She’s lived in Portugal for many years, set up a language school there in a small town and she’s back in Singapore visiting, so she’s also here somewhere tonight.
I quote from her letter. She says: “it’s only now that I live abroad that I find myself proudly flying the Singapore flag. Singaporeans inevitably carry Singapore with them wherever they go and they sow a bit of Singapore through which they pass on the will to be the best they can. I have lived out there for 15 years now and in all that time my Singaporeaness has faded very little and I’m very grateful that it has stood by me and stood the test of time”.
I think we have something very special here. You remember sometime back, some of us will, our first National Day Parades, the first few. There were no fancy lighting effects, no video linkups, no goodie bags, just a parade, contingents marching one after the other. Soldiers from first Battalion, 2nd Battalion, 20th Battalion, 100th Battalion plus one or two mass displays, lion and dragon dances and the school bands provided the marching music. I was one of them. I marched three times in the band, once as an officer cadet. One year it rained, 1968. After the parade had formed up in the Padang. Those of you who were there will never forget it. It was a downpour, we froze, we were drenched. Our instruments had to be turned upside down to pour the water out. We watched to see if we stood or if we ran for cover. Nobody ran for cover, we shivered but we stood there and we marched with pride. Along the route the crowds gathered to cheer us. So, this was a people determined to succeed and we did.
To start off with parades like that, the spirit is special but to enjoy a 40th National Day Parade in the circumstances which we have, that’s unique. It’s good luck, it’s good government, it’s strong people. You look at the other countries which have reached this point after independence, after the war. The problems that have beset them, the existential angst they feel.
Look at Israel at this point in their history which is probably about 1990. The problems are almost insoluble for them but for us with prosperity, peace with our neighbours, with our people looking forward to a better future and when you have the parade, the same spirit, the same togetherness, that same conviction that we will do our best for Singapore.
I think with this situation, with this climate and this mood, we have every reason to rejoice. We can do this again for another 40 years because here in Singapore, we’ve created something which is special, which is unique and precious. How have we done it? It is our people, our ideas and our actions. Most important of all we’ve created a Singapore spirit. We are courageous but compassionate, we are confident but never complacent. It’s a spirit which will hold us together as one united people, each one doing his part, each one contributing to remaking our nation and building our home and together we will make it a vibrant, global city called home. Thank you very much.

   singaporewebsite update april",13872,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong reflects on the nation's remarkable transformation over the past 40 years, highlighting its economic success, educational advancements, and strong international relationships. He emphasizes the resilience and unity displayed by Singaporeans, particularly in response to the tsunami disaster, showcasing the nation's capacity for compassion and effective action on the global stage.

PM Lee outlines ongoing efforts to enhance Singapore's economic landscape, stressing the importance of innovation, enterprise, and research and development (R&D). He announces plans to establish a Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council and a National Research Foundation to support long-term strategic research areas, indicating a proactive approach to maintaining Singapore's competitive edge.

The speech also addresses social cohesion and the importance of inclusivity in Singapore's progress. PM Lee discusses initiatives to support lower-income families and older Singaporeans, underscoring the government's commitment to ensuring that all citizens benefit from the nation's prosperity.

Significant urban development plans are detailed, particularly the transformation of the Marina Bay area into a vibrant global hub, enhancing Singapore's appeal as a place to live, work, and play. This includes the development of new downtown areas, the integration of arts and culture facilities, and the creation of a continuous, lively waterfront.

Overall, PM Lee's speech paints a picture of a forward-looking Singapore, continually striving for improvement in economic, social, and urban domains, while fostering a strong national spirit and sense of unity among its people."
2006,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, my focus tonight is on Singapore’s future in a rapidly changing world. The world is changing faster than ever. Singapore’s changing rapidly too and we have to adapt. We have to adapt both as individuals and also as a society and a nation to what’s happening around us. Tonight, I will cover five key issues which are crucial to our long-term growth and prosperity. First, the economy which is a precondition for everything we want to do. Secondly, the region, what’s happening around us which has a powerful effect on our lives. Then three issues for Singapore. One, our population, two the digital age and how it’s changing us, and three heartware, the key to keeping us Singaporean.
I met one grassroots leader last week. He asked me, “What goodies will you be announcing?” I had to tell him that I would be talking about subjects which are going to be very important for us for the long term but are subjects which have no quick final solutions and therefore, not suitable for goodies. But we have to discuss them, we have to understand them, we have to share views on them because they will have major implications for our society and how we respond as a nation will determine our future.
Let me start off talking about the economy. We have done well these last couple of years and particularly this year and I’m confident that the economy is going to grow. It’s not just the numbers but it’s also the quality of the growth and what the growth shows of what we are able to do and what people think of us. We have set as a target for our growth for the long term, we set three to five per cent growth. But in the last two or three years, we have done better than that. We had 10, then we had 7-plus, this year first half we’ve had 9, for the year we expect 7. I think that when the conditions are good and the sun is shining, we should go for it, as fast as we can as much as we can. Get the growth put it under our belt, put it aside a little bit, so when the thunderstorm comes again, we will be ready. But let me tell you why the growth these last few years shows that we have what it takes to succeed.
You look at the projects which have come in. You look at what we have been able to draw in, the IR, the Integrated Resort at Marina South, five billion dollars of a project, a very major commitment by the investor, a vote of confidence in Singapore. We were not sure that when we launched the IR tender, we would get such an overwhelming response but we got good bids. We have awarded a good project and now we are calling another bid for a second IR in Sentosa and we have got four investors who are interested and I think we are going to have a second good integrated resort in Singapore.
In manufacturing, we are competitive. Again we have got big and very important projects. Shell has a multibillion dollar petrochemical project here on Pulau Bukom, also on Jurong Island, spread in two places. Exxon Mobil is planning a very major project here, past several important milestones although they haven not made a final decision yet. In electronics, we are getting wafer fabs to come to Singapore. We have had two big projects recently. One was French, the other one is a Korean and German joint venture. Why are they here? It’s not because we have low wages, it’s not because we are competing at the bottom. It’s because we are the best place for high quality investments, clean, safe, predictable. Clean environment, working systems and confidence – confidence that Singaporeans have what it takes to adapt to a changing world and are willing to change. Confidence that the government knows what it’s doing and can get people to go with it. Confidence that the whole system works and if you plonk your investment here, few billion dollars, it will be safe, it will be profitable and people will work and there will be results. Therefore, more projects will come and therefore, more jobs and more growth will be created.
We are not just sitting here, waiting for projects to come. We are developing our capabilities and one of the capabilities we are working on is R &D, Research and Development. We are starting with three R&D areas. One, biomedical, two, water technology and three, interactive and digital media. They are just words but let me tell you why we went into these three areas so that you get some image of it. Biotechnology, biomedicine because we’ve already got a base, we have done a lot of work, we have got scientists here, we have got a reputation and we are beginning to see results. We are going to put more investments into biomedicine so that we will be able to do clinical research. In other words, take projects from the lab to the bedside in the hospital, so that we experiment to discover how we can treat patients best, which treatments work, what is the best procedure, how we can not only get the R&D results but also improve medical services and medical care in Singapore.
Water, I don’t have to tell you why it is important to Singapore but it is an area where we have an advantage. Our companies are among the leading players. We have got Keppel, we have got Sembawang, we have gotHyflux. So I think it’s an area where we should put some money and stay ahead because for a country like Singapore to be able to export water technology to the Middle East or to China, I think that is something remarkable and which we can do. Interactive and digital media, what does that mean? It means computer games, it means making movies, animation, cartoons. Very competitive business but one where maybe we have a chance and we can’t afford not to be there. I think we have a chance to be there. I give you one example, Japanese Anime, I don’t know how many of you watch Japanese cartoons, but these are the Japanese style cartoons, animation. One big Japanese company has gone into joint venture with NTU (Nanyang Technological University) to produce anime. Why did they do that? We don’t speak Japanese, we are not so many cartoon fans in Singapore. But NTU has developed computer technology so that they can produce anime cartoons 40 per cent cheaper than other people. We have gone into anime and there will be other activities, other games, other technologies where we can develop and maintain a position.
We are developing our external wing. Our companies are going abroad and doing well. You read about the big companies in the newspapers but tonight let me tell you about one small company. Tharman came across it and mentioned it to me. He was in Shenyang recently and he came across a Singaporean who was selling curry puffs in Shenyang. He talked to the young man, turns out that the father is in Ang Mo Kio Central, used to be my constituency. Tip Top curry puffs. Father is successful here, the son went to China to venture. He looked around Shenyang, he concluded that the food was not so interesting and varied as if you go to Shanghai or to Guangzhou, so there’s an opportunity to sell something which they have never met, Singapore curry puffs. Very successful, I think he has got five shops in Shenyang and now he is going to go further north, Harbin, also sell curry puffs. The next time you go the Harbin Ice Festival – cold sculptures but hot curry puffs.
We are creating a wide variety of jobs in Singapore for all Singaporeans. Tourism with the IR as I told you just now, 30,000 jobs we think, that not counting the Sentosa IR. Manufacturing, good jobs, not just for graduates but technicians, diploma holders, semi-skilled workers all along the line. We are trying to get more people to do the manufacturing jobs, more Singaporeans to get into it. We are still trying but we hope Singaporeans will make the effort. We are going into aerospace maintenance, MRO, maintenance, repair and overhaul because people are flying jets all over the region and if you want your jet repaired, you want to make sure you have confidence in the place which is repairing it and the people who are repairing it and Singapore is the place. We are building a big aerospace park in Seletar and there will be opportunities for engineers, inspectors, technicians, whole range of people and you don’t have to be in the field. You can convert and go into the field, learn the skills. There was one young man, Mr Goh Zeng Liang, he is only 35 years old. He used to be a car mechanic. He upgraded himself, joined SIA engineering, now he is an aerospace technician. From repairing your car to becoming an aerospace technician and he enjoys his present job because it means precision and attention to detail. And as he said “With cars, I didn’t have to be so precise, with aeroplanes, I must get it exactly right!” So that’s the sort of person I want in the industry.
We also want older and lower skilled workers to have jobs. We are creating jobs generally in the economy across the board but specifically, I think we have to pay attention to older lower-skilled workers, get them employed. I’m very encouraged because with a growing economy, companies are hiring and maybe they have no choice, maybe they are getting the message but they are hiring more older workers. If you look at the employment rates, the percentage of older people working, the men, aged 55 and above, say 55 to 64 years old, the group who are most vulnerable and at risk of being retired early, their employment rates have gone up dramatically this year. A lot more of them are at work again which is good but we must not slacken because asSwee Say reminds me, we have gone through this cycle several times. Each time there is a down cycle, people take training upgrading very seriously, then the economy recovers, then they slacken off, they find jobs, then down cycle, they are scrambling again. I think that this time, there is an up cycle, let’s concentrate on the older workers, let’s get them retrained because I fear when the next down cycle comes, it’s going to hit them harder and we are going to need all the lead time we have in order to be ready for it and be able to protect the older workers in the next recession.
So our economy is doing well. But of course our economy depends on the region and on external factors. We don’t prosper by ourselves. We prosper in Asia. If we were Singapore in Africa, however hardworking we are, I don’t think we would be sitting like this, pretty. But we are Singapore in Asia and around us if we look at the world, the outlook is good. In Asia, China and India are doing well, Japan is also not doing badly. The energy is there, the drive is there. Southeast Asia is also carried along and so we are benefiting but there are some major risks in the world. And when you are looking forward you can never say this is the way things will go. All you can say is here are some possibilities and here are some things which can go wrong. And there are a lot of things which can go bump in the night and go wrong. But tonight I just want to share with you two of our worries.
One is oil prices because of the Middle East. You have been reading the news, you know about Iran and the nuclear programme, their nuclear programme. You know about Iraq and the civil war which is going on there. You know about Israel and the war they have fought with Hizbollah which has altered perceptions of the Israeli defence forces in the Middle East and is going to have long term consequences. The problems are far from over. It’s because of the uncertainties in the Middle East, that is why today oil is US$70 plus a barrel and in Singapore electricity is expensive and bus fares have to go up. It’s not that there’s not enough oil. It’s the fear, the uncertainty, the risk that’s keeping the oil prices high and hurting us. But if something goes wrong in the Middle East and there is a flare up, oil prices will not stay at US$70. They may go to US$120, they may double to US$150. I think it will have a very big impact on us. It will have a big impact on the whole world, create a global recession. We have to be psychologically prepared for that. The lower income groups we can help them. We have Utilities Save, we have various schemes, many schemes to help the lower income. We have been doing it, it has been helpful. As the oil prices stay high or if they get higher, we will do more as we will consider doing more next year in the budget. But the economy as a whole, if this happens and there’s an oil crisis, an oil shock, then we will have to work together and pull through as we pulled through after the Asian crisis, as we pulled through after 911. Working together, cutting costs, showing that we are different and taking the adjustments which we have to make in order to make ourselves competitive again.
The second worry which we have is terrorism. It’s not a new problem but it’s a problem which is far from over and what has happened in the UK these last couple of weeks, last week and you’ve been reading how they arrested a group about to blow up nine aeroplanes crossing the Atlantic, shows that it’s a very serious risk. These were not people from the Middle East or directly Al-Qaeda operatives. These were British-born, second- generation immigrants in Britain who got organized and were linked up with Al-Qaeda and were going to do mass murder on an unimaginable scale, home-grown terrorists. Is it a far away thing? No. It’s a danger to us too. It’s a danger to us physically. This evening when you come here, it’s like going into a battlefield. So many obstacles and scans but the greater danger is not the physical one. It’s a danger to our racial harmony and our social cohesion, that something like this happening here or even not here but nearby can pull our racial harmony apart and destroy us. That’s why we have to continue to take it very seriously, to continue to emphasize racial harmony, continue to focus on the community engagement programme and to work with the community leaders and all the IRCCs, the Inter Racial Confidence Circles and to share with you our worries and what we know so you can help us to deal with the problem and to keep the problem manageable if it should happen.
These are things which can go wrong. If you look around us in ASEAN, while overall things are good, we also see problems which already are in front of us. Some ASEAN countries are doing very well like Vietnam which is taking off but others have real difficulties. Thailand, for example, has had some tough time for the last almost a year. They are going into general elections for the second time this year. In fact third time in two years in October and even the general election may not be the end of their political problems because the opposition to Prime Minister Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai Party is very strong despite their getting two-thirds of the vote. In Malaysia, there are deep political differences between former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir and the present Prime Minister, Datuk Abdullah Badawi. I think everyone hopes that the problems will be resolved soon. They are not our problems. Bilaterally between Singapore and Malaysia, the negotiations over the bridge, over airspace and sand have ended. There are some other matters which are still outstanding but these are on the back burner for the time being and meanwhile, we are working together with Malaysia, fostering our cooperation in areas where we can have mutual benefit.
Indonesia also has significant difficulties. The government has tackled some very tough problems. Last year, they cut subsidies on petrol, on diesel, on kerosene, electricity, raised prices significantly, a very courageous move which was essential to them. But they have other things which they need to do. They have got labour laws which need to be changed, they have got tax laws which need to be changed. They have got investment laws which need to be changed but politically very difficult. They have to go through the DPR, the Parliament. It’s a long process and investors are waiting to see when it is going to happen. We are working with Indonesia to cooperate with them to work on Special Economic Zones in the Riaus, Batam, Bintan and Karimun, so that what it is more difficult to do in Indonesia across the board, they can do first in their special economic zones, get it going, demonstrate and then you will be able, it works, there is basis to extend it to the rest of Indonesia. We are cooperating with Indonesia because we believe it’s good for us if Indonesia prospers, it’s good for ASEAN if Indonesia prospers.
These regional problems don’t affect us directly but indirectly they affect us because they condition the climate of ASEAN as a whole and when investors look at ASEAN, and they see the clouds as well as the bright spots, they have one general impression and Singapore is part of that. ASEAN has to get its act together. We talk about ASEAN being the body with two wings, China, India taking off and carrying us along. But if your body is not strong, and the two wings are very strong, whether you are a bird or an aeroplane, you will have a problem. So, it’s necessary for ASEAN to be strong in order to benefit from China and India. Otherwise they fly off, we are left in pieces on the ground and that’s why we will continue work with our ASEAN partners to promote growth and stability in Southeast Asia. But if you take the situation as a whole, and make a considered assessment, I would say it’s good. We just have to be ready psychologically and be prepared in case one of the things goes wrong, we will not be taken by surprise.
One important plus factor for us with this external world is our reputation, our high international standing. If you want to be special, if you want people to notice you, if we want Singapore to stand out, then our reputation is critical. And our reputation is good, which is one reason why we are getting our investments and growth. Next month, our reputation is on the line. S2006, the IMF and World Bank are having their annual meetings in Singapore. There’ will be 16,000 delegates and visitors here. It’s bigger than anything we have done. Let’s work together to make it the best meeting they have had and let’s do it all of us. We said four million smiles but it’s actually also four million pairs of hands and hard work. It’s not just smiles to welcome guests but it’s also service from the heart, not just being nice to them but knowing what to do and knowing your job and being able to take care of them and leave them with a clear impression that this is a special place and that what they can do in Singapore they can’t do in many other places in the world. If you impress them, if Singaporeans impress them, that means the taxi drivers, the immigration officials, the counter-staff, the shop girls, the officials organising the meetings, the liaison officers bringing the people from place to place, getting them to the right place at the right time, you will do a greater favour to Singapore and be more effective than any EDB or Tourism Board advertising campaign. Because this will be the real thing and not just a glossy picture. And what is impressing people is not what the ministers or the high officials do, but what ordinary Singaporeans are able to do, so that if they go back they can tell their people in Singapore, everybody is special. I think that is the impression we want to leave them and that is the impression we should leave tourists and visitors who come to Singapore for a long, long time to come.
Let me now talk about our population. If we want our economy to grow, if we want to be strong internationally, then we need a growing population and not just numbers but also talents in every field in Singapore. Today many more Singaporeans are living, working, travelling, operating abroad, studying abroad. The doors are open to us, to a broad range of Singaporeans not just at the top but across the board and not only are the doors open but we’re being headhunted. American universities, Ivy League now admits students from overseas and they do it on a needs-blind basis. What does it mean needs-blind? It means if you need they will take care of you. If you can’t afford to pay the fees they will help you to pay the fees or help you to find the work. If you’re outstanding, they will give you a full fee scholarship, no bond. PSC has full fee scholarship five years. We are competing with them and in a few cases, we’ve had students who have accepted the American university scholarship and turned down the PSC. So, we are being targeted. JC students to university, Poly students graduating, doing well, they also are being targeted, sought after. I went to Sydney, visited the university of New South Wales because they’re setting up a university here. They asked me to give away some awards. I went, I gave away the awards. I said what are these awards? They said these are awards given to the top poly students from Singapore who go to study at the University of New South Wales, donated by alumni from Singapore. We have poly students there, I met them, they are all doing very well, bright, able, ambitious and many opportunities open and good for them. The Vice-Chancellor told me “we are happy to take them in as students but we are even happier when they stay”.
So I came back, I asked NUS and NTU “Have you got any scholarships for top poly students?” They said “We are getting them soon.”
So we are getting targeted and our workers are getting targeted. In the region, in China when companies look for chief financial officers, they look for Singaporeans, capable well-trained, speak mandarin, honest, not so easy to find. But from Singapore, our standards are high, they will take them. In the Middle East, hotels are hiring people, looking for people who have worked in Singapore, Singapore experience. In fact, foreign workers who have had experience in Singapore are in demand. So the shipyard workers after they spend four years or six years here, they go to the Middle East – high demand, qualified, no doubt about their abilities. I’ve been asking MOM, “Can’t we persuade them to stay here, not six years, maybe eight years, 10 years, don’t let them help our competitors?” We are trying but it’s a global market and we are in demand. We have to accept this reality. In fact, it’s good. Our universities and polys have high-standing. Singaporeans are in demand everywhere and the opportunities are there, go for it. We respect the choice of those who work overseas. In fact, we encourage Singaporeans to go abroad, spend time abroad, gain experience, understand how the world operates and then come back to Singapore. But of course, while it’s good to have people abroad, we also hope that they don’t spend all their life there and at some stage, they will decide to come back to Singapore. We also worry, we worry because if every trained and skilled Singaporean is abroad, then who is going to be here in Singapore, jaga rumah, looking after the home, keeping Singapore dynamic, vibrant, beating? If we have so many people overseas but not many in Singapore, where will the next generation of Singaporeans come from? How will we get talented and skilled Singaporeans to keep this place going? What can we do?
I think there are three things we have to do. One, we have to maintain strong links with the Singaporeans who are abroad, with our overseas network so that they become a strength for us and not a loss. Two, we need to encourage, make sure that we have enough babies and three, we need immigration, welcome talent to come to Singapore. I will only talk about our overseas network briefly and then talk about immigration becausebabies is a subject you know about. It’s just a matter of having the babies. First of all, overseas Singaporeans, we have got to keep in touch with our network overseas. We have been doing it in various ways, ad hoc. We’ve set up now an Overseas Singaporean Unit, an OSU in Prime Minister’s Office. Wong Kan Seng is supervising this and the idea of the OSU is to engage Singaporeans overseas, keep them updated, make sure that they know what’s happening in Singapore, keep them part of our global family. And we want to do this not just as the government taking the initiative but also to help the students or the overseas Singaporeans take the initiative, organize and link up with Singapore. For example, yesterday there was a little conference in Singapore called Confluence 2006. Teo Chee Hean went. It was an initiative by a student who was in UCL, University College London. He studied law there, he wanted to organize an event to have all the Singapore students who are overseas who happen to be back now on holiday in Singapore to gather together and to be able to have a dialogue. They took the initiative, they organized it, 900 people showed up. I think they had a good discussion with the ministers and I think this is something we should encourage. In fact some of these organisers will be invited to tea. We need to link up with them, serious events, not so serious events. Recently there was a chilli crab festival in New York and London, supposed to be for foreigners but I imagine a lot of Singaporeans must have showed up and why not, it’s a social occasion. Let’s help them network, let’s help them get together. If it has to be laksa, bak kut teh, Tiger beer so be it.
We also have to help Singaporeans to come back and when they are ready to come back to link them up so that they can find jobs, to link them up so that their children can get into schools and to help them to integrate back in smoothly. So when they come back, you don’t have a crashing of gears and suddenly from a different environment, you come back to Singapore, such a shock that you may go off again. It takes some adjustment and some getting used to be back in Singapore and I think we can do a lot to help them to merge in. The Overseas Singapore Unit is going to be launching its online portal soon. It’s the best way to keep in touch with everybody. Wong Kan Seng is going to be in China and we will be launching it in Shanghai where I think there are 7,000 overseas Singaporeans. We need to use such links, help them link up with one another, help Singaporeans in Singapore link up with the people who are abroad.
First, we must deal with our diaspora to make them part of the family and treat them as part of the family. Secondly, we must continue to promote immigration into Singapore because just as we accept that Singaporeans have the world as their oyster, so too we must promote immigration here and let this be one of the options which talent from around the world will look for when they are considering where to go and live. Many countries are doing this. The Australians are working hard at it, the Canadians are working hard at it. Even the Americans have lucky draws for Green Cards. You know what a green card is? It’s a PR. Even China is scouting for talent. China with 1,300 million people, looking for talent. They’re offering scholarships to top students from other countries. Their professional football teams are hiring foreign footballers. They want to get into the World Cup Finals. We must do the same. We have to do this. We are setting up a Citizenship and Population Unit also in PMO. So we will have two, one OSU Overseas Singaporeans, one Citizenship and Population to bring people into Singapore.
We have to promote our immigration programme overseas. Countries know, people know Singapore. They no longer think that Singapore is somewhere in China. They know Singapore is special, they even have heard of the little red dot but they don’t know that Singapore is out looking for talent. If you go to Channel News Asia website or the Straits Times Interactive website, you will find the banner ad on top, click on this, check out your eligibility for Australian PR, or Green Card, give it a try. That should be the Singapore advertisement down there. Our CPU, our Citizenship and Population Unit, click here, application form for Singapore PR will go to you by email. That’s what we need to do, get our message, get people to be interested. Then we can choose and have good ones, capable, able to make a contribution, join Singapore.
We must look for all kinds of talent. It’s not just numbers. We’re looking for people with ability, with drive, with initiative and ideas and not just one kind of initiative and ideas, graduates, or professionals or bankers and lawyers, but all kinds. Let met give you some examples. Mustaq, Mustaq Ahmad. You’ve heard of Mustafa’s. Mr Mustaq Ahmad, he was an immigrant. He came from Uttar Pradesh in India as a young boy. He has made a very successful business here. Now it’s a shopper’s paradise, 24/7 and it’s not just Indian tourists who shop at Mustafa’s now. Singaporeans go there to shop because it’s good, it’s cheap, wide range, fresh products. More than 1,000 staff work for him. People who think that if you have a foreigner come here, he’s taking away a Singaporean job, you are wrong. You get the right foreigner here, he creates thousands of jobs for Singaporeans like Mr Mustaq and you need to get more people like him.
There are other talents. Some of you may know David Gan. He’s a celebrity hairstylist. According to the newspapers, it costs $250 a haircut. He came here from Malaysia to work. He has been here 22 years. Recently, he got his citizenship last December and he said it was the best Christmas present he had ever received because “Singapore groomed me, gave me many opportunities. I felt Singaporean in my heart for the past 12 years”. If you go on paper qualifications, he will not qualify. But you go on talent skill, he has something which most of us don't have. You want people who don't have that paper but have that brain and that initiative. Not easy to find and sometimes, they get away. I give you one example where I wish where we got the fellow. A Chinese illegal immigrant came to Singapore. We found him, we kicked him out. He changed his passport, he got back in. When next we found him, he was running at least five hawker stalls. He was employing at least 11 PRC Chinese. I don't know whether legal or illegal and quite a number more of Singaporeans. We suspect he had even bigger business but we couldn't prove but unfortunately because he was a second-time illegal immigrant, we had to throw him out again. So one day we should get him back and we should get other people like that to come back and to come to Singapore because they have the spunk, the drive and they will make it with sheer grit and get to the top one day.
Singapore offers something unique. We are an Asian society with an Asian heritage and culture and roots and yet we are an open and a cosmopolitan society. We use English as a common language, we keep our mother tongues and our cultures intact and alive and people from many cultures and backgrounds can come here, live here, be comfortable here and enjoy, integrate into our society. Become Singapore and yet retain what is unique about them and the links which they have back to their own cultures, their own homelands, their own sense of identity. And this is not just the three major races, Chinese or the Indians or the Malays but also manyother smaller groups. In the earlier generations, we had Parsis, we had Jews from Iraq, we had Armenians, we had Arabs – little, little groups came to Singapore and made their home here and made their contribution here. Today, we get people from all over the world too. We have people from Turkey, there are Portuguese, somebody from Venezuela, somebody from Morocco, even a Korean or two, some Russians. And they add colour and diversity to this society. So our cuisine is something special. Singaporeans love food. You want Korean ginseng chicken, you can get the real thing cooked by a Korean. You want Arab food, you go to Arab Street, you can eat shawarma, which is shish kebab, you can smoke the hubble-bubble, the waterpipe – now harder because new rules on no smoking – but it's something different for Singapore. So when we get Middle Eastern visitors, they go to Arab Street, they feel very much at home. They are very happy. And we have other customs too. Recently, there was a splendid wedding in Singapore. The groom came riding on a white horse. He was a Marwari, it's an Indian group, Indian businessman, very successful caste. So the zoo is now thinking of going into the service of providing horses and elephants for weddings. I think it's good. But I would say this works both ways. Because we are open and cosmopolitan, so the foreigners come here and they are comfortable here. But we want to be open and cosmopolitan, and that is why we need the foreigners to come to add to our colour, to make this a special exciting, diverse, cosmopolitan place. Then we can remain special and become even better than the Singapore that we have been. So we encourage immigrants to keep their cultures and their languages alive, to keep the links with the countries of origin and one of the ways to do this is language. So in schools, in education, the Ministry of Education will do more to support the study of foreign languages. Wherever there is demand, Hindi, Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, we will make it easy for the foreign students to learn this and in fact we will make it easy for Singaporeans who want to learn these languages as third languages because it will also help to prepare Singaporeans to link up with the opportunities outside especially I think in Southeast Asia and in the Middle East.
So, there are things which we can do as a government in order to open our doors and bring immigrants in. But more importantly, as a society, we as Singaporeans, each one of us, we have to welcome immigrants. Welcome new immigrants. I know that some Singaporeans don't agree. They have reservations, they worried about the competition, they are unhappy that immigrants some here, don’t do national service or maybe they just don’t like immigrants living next to them. I mean, once in a while, I hear stories of HDB residents who complain to the media that some immigrants have moved in, foreigners, they don’t feel safe. Please move them away or compensate the HDB resident. It affects the environment.
I understand these concerns because somebody new coming in, fitting in – they are different. A Chinese-Chinese is different from a Singapore-Chinese. An Indian-Indian is different from a Singapore Indian. In fact when I met Mr Koizumi last year and I told him, you know we are bringing in Chinese-Chinese, Indian-Indians, he looked at me, he said “Chinese-Chinese?” I had to explain, “Yeah, indeed, they come from China. Singapore Chinese come from Singapore. We are different.”
But we are different doesn't mean we have to reject them. We have to take a big-hearted approach. Our forefathers were immigrants too. If they had been kept out of Singapore, we wouldn't be here today. And to grow and flourish, we must invite people to come who can help us to achieve our goals. And if they come from China, or India or Russia, well, if they can integrate into our society, and make a contribution, I say they are Singaporean too. They may not do NS but their sons will do NS and that is the way to build a Singapore for Singaporeans. That is the difference between American and Europe. In America, they take people from all over the world. They don't become fully American immediately but you will have Russian-American, Chinese-American, Korean-American, German-American, African-American, Latin-American, Spanish-American and so on. You hyphenate. So I know that you are not quite the same but you are half American already. And in the next generation, well, you are more American after four-five generations, the name is different but actually you speak the same twang.
The Europeans don't do that. You don’t have Chinese-Germans, American-Germans, Singaporean-Germans. Not possible. The society is different. It's not that just you don’t have Chinese-German. If you are a Chinese and living in Germany, you will find it very hard, you cannot get integrated into the society and, therefore, it's a tremendous competitive disadvantage which the Europeans have compared to the United States and we have to be more like the US than like the Europeans and we can have, we will hyphenate, Australian-Singaporean, Chinese-Singaporeans, Chinese-Chinese Singaporeans. But make them one of us and if we meet one of them, let's be friendly, let's go out of our way to show them around, help them, make them feel at home. If you are a taxi driver and somebody comes into your taxi and speaks with a Chinese mainland accent, show him around, tell him where to go, he may already know if he is here for sometime but show him to the right place. Don't take him for a longer drive. It’s a small example but it is what we should look out for as a mindset and attitude. Of course, the immigrants also have to make the effort to fit in, participate in community activities, which many of them do. We see them at National Day dinners, our block parties, they come assiduously. And they tell you, “In the country where I come from, you never have a chance to have a block party to meet the MP or the Minister but in Singapore, you can if you participate.” Their children study in our schools, often do well. So even if the first generation is not completely Singaporean, the second generation growing up here will be and will contribute to Singapore.
So this year we have had quite a number of foreign students who have become Singaporeans, who have got scholarships. One girl got the President's Scholarship from China, another boy also from China took up citizenship, got an SAF Scholarship. So he is going to serve much longer than two-and-a-half years and a third one also a boy from India. He is taking up an overseas merit scholarship, becoming a teacher. All children of immigrants came here late maybe eight, nine years old or early teens, become Singaporean, almost speak Singlish.
So I met the OMS scholar, Shyam Srinivasan. He came at 14. He went to Geylang Methodist Secondary School, neighbourhood school but did good for him. Then he went to Victoria Junior College. Now, he has taken up citizenship, obtained a scholarship. When he finishes, comes back, completes his NS, I think when he goes into classrooms, he will be helping us to educate the next generation of Singaporeans. And we want many more like them. We can give more scholarships, we are not short of scholarships. What we are short of is talent and the more we can get our talent, as Phillip Yeo says “kidnap them”, I think the better off we will be.
Besides the population issue, another thing which is happening to us right now and it’s going to have a big impact on us is the digital age. The new technologies, the Internet, handphones, PDAs, all kinds of things which beep, which vibrate, which communicate, which connect us to cyberspace, not in Heaven but somewhere on Earth. It is a completely different world. We haven’t talked about it but you just think back one generation how things have changed. When I was in university, away three years, came back once. I telephoned home three times, once a year to report results. Very big event, very difficult to set up, costs a lot of money, you speak for three minutes, you put down the phone. Now, families communicate across the world as if they were side by side. I met one mother who told me my daughter is in London, a teenager. Every night she gets home, she will SMS me to tell me she has got home safely. I met another father, this one a grassroots leader in West Coast with Iswaran, his son is in Florida, grown up, married but everyday, he will talk to his son, video-camera, MSN. Microsoft Network. Almost free. It’s instant. If he is on the other side of the world, you will call him, if he is two tables away from you, you will also telephone call him. So we have changed. How we think and concentrate has changed. When I used to study or when I work now still, I turn off the music, I go to a quiet place, I open one file, I focus on one major thing because then you bring all your powers to bear and you make the right decision.
Now children are multi-tasking. At least they tell me they are multi-tasking. I watch mine, I am sure you watch yours too. Homework open, music, earphones, Internet chat, game. And I am told you are not only surfing but multi-surfing because if you surf one site it is boring, but if you have three or four at once any time you can just flick. Need any information in the world, just Google it. If I ask them what is an encyclopaedia, they will say “Google it”. So attention spans have gotten shorter, when you are bored just switch. It’s a different way of thinking, a different approach to life. How we get to know one another, how we establish trust and links with one another has changed. The older generation worked face to face. Mr Lim Kim San always used to say he hates e-mail because you can’t feel the person. You call a person sit in front of you, you talk to him, you exchange views with him, you get a sense what’s going on, what he really thinks and then you can make a decision. E-mail back and forth, you lead to misunderstanding. But now young people they are making friends on the Internet. They never meet one another but exchange photographs on MySpace. What is MySpace? It’s a place where you paste your photographs and the photographs can make friends with each other. And I am told some young people even get married on the Internet. I don’t recommend it. So it’s a different world but it’s one in which I think Singaporeans will do well.
Our people take very easily to IT. It has opened up many opportunities for us, for our economy, lots of jobs which Singaporeans can do and broader benefits for the whole economy. Without IT, PSA would be out of business. Without IT, we wouldn’t be a banking hub. Without IT, Changi Airport wouldn’t be able to be a first-class airport. But with IT we make the most of our talents and our brains. And with IT we also become connected as a more participative society if we make the effort.
And we have come a long way, exploiting IT, making it a pervasive part of our lives. Singaporeans have done lots and lots of things on line. So if you go into cyberspace, you will find Singapore in many places. I trawled a few which I would like to share with you. Let me start with food which is nearest to Singaporeans’ hearts. This is a food website call Chubby Hubby. Very popular, lots of food, lots of dishes, lots of interesting places to eat. But the web is not just for individuals and for blogs. It’s also for communities to gather for people to share interest to work to exchange with one another, to pursue their passions together. So the next picture shows you one such website. It’s Club Snap. It’s a photography website for enthusiasts, to critique one another’s work, to organise activities, and to share and display their successes, very popular. Young and old now go on to the Internet.
The young, even children, have blogs and some of the blogs are quite good. This one is a blog by a little girl called Li Ying done together with her father and obviously they are very proud of what they have done and proud of the family. And there are many other such. Old people also put up blogs. This one is calledBullockcartwater, ngau che soi (牛车水). So writing about the neighbourhood, festivals, food, the people, the activities, the place, the ties that bind us to Singapore. In this case, Chinatown. The next slide you may have seen. Talkingcock.com. If you want humour, you go there. Some of the jokes are not bad. Not all of them. The next slide is not so funny but very popular. Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Got the tax questions, ask IRAS. Because two-thirds of Singaporeans pay their income tax on this website.
So across the board, whether it’s entertainment, whether it’s culture, whether it’s personal interest, whether it’s community, whether it’s government, we are there and we are determined to take full advantage of all the digital opportunities which are opening up. We are building the infrastructure in Singapore. The InfocommDevelopment Authority plans to wire up the whole country so that it’s wired and wireless. Fully connected, wired so all the homes, all the offices eventually will have fibre to the home. That means very high speed connection and all the public places will be wireless. Anytime, anywhere, anyone. So you can just go on, start up you laptop or your PDA or Skype and communicate. So we will be fully into the cyber world.
We are preparing our young for this new age. We have made IT, the Internet an integral part of our school life. Many experiments go on. Some have gone even further than others. You look at the polytechnics, what Republic Poly has done. Every student has a notebook, the whole campus is Wi-Fi, wireless connected. You hand up your tutorials electronically, you do the homework on your notebook, you pass up on-line. At 11 o’clock at night, if you haven’t passed up your homework, the site logs off, too late, you are done for. So we are completely prepared for this and we are going to include every Singaporean in this whether you are poor or not, whether you are young or old, you will be part of this. So we have got all sorts of schemes to help lower income families with school-going children to own PCs, to access the Internet, to be able to do their homework, their projects, same as their peers. So nobody is left behind. We cannot have a digital divide splitting Singaporeans those who know and have computers from those who don’t know and don’t have. And older people are one of those groups who need extra help connecting up to computers. So we will work with them in the community centres. We have got centres called CitizenConnect. We have got Internet access for the old folks and for those who are not so familiar. We have helpers to help them and to make them comfortable, we have helpers with a little bit of grey hair, so that you would understand their problem and will be able to communicate with them and get them to be comfortable. So with the digital age, I think we are going to move ahead. But we also must know some of the problems which the digital age will bring. It will change the texture of our society because it will also create new problems which need to be managed. We have more information, faster information, but at the same time, not necessarily more accurate information. There will be half-truths and untruths which will circulate and you wouldn’t know which is which readily and there will be good views but also bad views extremist views which will divide our society. And the terrorist groups, the Jihadi groups, they are on the Internet, recruiting, spreading their message, preparing attacks and we have to know this. And apart from specific bad things, you also have a new phenomenon that you are in so many places on the Internet that you have to make an effort to come back and be in the same place together. We used to say broadcasting, that means you put out a channel, TV station, or TV programme, everybody watches, broad segment of the population. Now they say narrow casting. I have this special interest in Frisbee or whatever it is, I aim for this group of the audience. That group has a different interest. He is watching a different channel. This group, the third group, another channel. So if you have got cable TV, you may 100 channels. We are all in different places and to bring us all together, to celebrate National Day or watch the parade, you need to make an extra effort to come together, to be a nation.
So these are new challenges and our society has to adapt to them. We have got to learn and practise new habits, especially the young people. First of all, be sceptical. Don’t believe every thing you see, not every thing which is published is true. Know what is right or wrong and be restrained, don’t overreact, you see something, you get excited, you work up your friends, your friends work you up, all of a sudden, you have gone and got aroused, done something, tomorrow you regret it. And we have got to protect ourselves from the bad things on the Internet, the negatives. The laws still apply and if somebody publishes racist ideas in a blog, we will track him down and we will take him to task according to the law as we have done. So, our society has to evolve, our media has to evolve, the mainstream media, television, newspapers, radio. They are under siege, they worry that all the eyeballs will go somewhere else. And they have to find ways to hold these eyeballs to keep making sure that they are relevant and they can fulfil their role which they have an important role to play. So they have to adapt but they have to remain objective, maintain a high quality newspaper and if you read something in the Straits Times or on CNA, you must know that it’s real, it’s quite different from reading this say on Talkingcock.com. You know which is the serious place and which one is for fun. Inform, educate, entertain, but play a constructive role in a new way in Singapore.
The Government has to adapt to the digital age. First of all, we need to find leaders who are of that age group, and that’s what we have been doing. That’s why in this election, we fielded a lot of people who are below 40 years old and we call them the P65 generation and they are reaching out to the young generation, understanding the young, being in tune with them, same wavelength, knowing how they react, how to move and motivate this group. But this is P65. By the next election, the P65 will not be so old. We better be P70 or maybe P75 but we have to move with the times and be with that generation.
We still need to get our message across. We will use the new media, multimedia, podcast, broadcast, all these things which you get in the Internet, or somebody sends to you by email, I think our ministries, our agencies have to experiment, have to try it out. They are trying it out in other countries. In America, I told you aboutMySpace where you post your pictures, the US Marine Corp has a picture in MySpace. They are making friends, hoping to get recruits. I think the Singapore Armed Forces maybe should also have a picture inMySpace. Singapore Police Force too. Maybe the PAP should be in MySpace because this is one of the mediums you are reaching out to. The multinationals are using blogs to communicate. Companies like Microsoft have staff who have blogs. Their politicians instead of sending out newsletters, they are spending time recording podcasts, putting podcasts on their websites. So their supporters will download, will listen will get their message. So we have to update, we have to try this out and we have to move with the times and our laws have to change, like our laws governing podcasts during elections or our laws on political videos, these are things which we have to update as we go along.
So we have to adapt to our message and our approach. We can’t just do the old way, just issue statements and rebuttals. I mean there is a standard form. You said this, I say this, you are wrong here. This is what it should be. I think we have to use all ways to get our message across, art, humour, wit, get our point across and be able to laugh at ourselves because if we can’t laugh at ourselves and we are standing on the pedestal, somebody is going to knock you down. So last year, for the rally I showed two little clips in a very small way, putting my toe into the water – “Tau Gay Not Enough” and “Tau Gay Never Enough”. That’s a harmless form of the new media but in fact, we have some serious decisions to make because we have to decide how far to go, what tone to set and it’s not just all fun and games. You put out a funny podcast. Then what will I do? I will hire Jack Neo to be my National Day Rally adviser. It will be a fun time, we will enjoy thoroughly, go home totally entertained but is this the way to deal serious issues? And the problem is it wouldn’t stop with fun and games. You will go to distortions, you will go to half-truths, you will go untruths, the tone of the debate will go down eventually, you race to the bottom.
You look at what has happened in other countries where the media are unrestrained where they have just gone and let go. Philippines, Taiwan, so much creative energy goes into political entertainment that even some of their own people who are more thoughtful sit back and worry and say “Is this really the way for our society to go”? So there was one commentary recently from somebody who talked about Taiwan. There is a Taiwanese TV programme called quan min luan jiang (全民乱讲). That means the whole of the citizenry talks rubbish. It’s a very funny programme. It’s on cable, a lot of Singaporeans watch it. So this commentary said quan min luanjiang (全民乱讲) is fine and now they have quan min kai jiang (全民开讲). That means we just open up and talk. But what about quan min hao hao jiang (全民好好讲) ? In other words, all of the people sincerely sit down seriously discuss serious problems. How do you get that message through? And that is the message which we want to keep. We have got to keep this government serious and responsible. We can’t govern based onjokes, we can’t govern based on soundbites, or distortions. You have to have debates which will add reasons, which will add enlightenment, which will come to a conclusion and not just end up in angry words and name calling or if you take the Taiwanese Parliament, where they throw things at each other and even the women are part of the battle. Yes, it’s good to be passionate, to care enough about what’s happening in the country, to want to fight for what you believe in, not just say something better still do something. But passion and emotion must also be balanced by logic, thinking, calmness and wisdom. There is no point just working people up, running down our institutions because at the end you make our problems harder, not easier to solve. It leads to nowhere. We have to debate. If we didn’t have a debate, I think we will come to the wrong conclusion but you must have debate to work out solutions for the larger good and for the longer term.
Singapore is changing and we must change. Some things are changing quickly. Other things take a little bit longer. There are few things which we should not change, which are fundamental to us. Like our integrity, caring for others, our sense of being special and unique and our passion for Singapore. That cannot change. But other things have to change. Sometimes it takes time. I think we have to work at it, plug at it and continue to find our way forward. By all means, if you think the government is doing something wrong, criticize us, criticize the government, criticize the leaders but be prepared to stand by your criticisms, to back up what you say and let’s argue it out. If the government disagrees, then we have to respond, if you criticize the government and the government does not respond, then the government has not taken you seriously. Number one, it does not deserve to be here. Number two, because if we do not respond, untruths would be repeated and will be believed and eventually will be treated as facts and the government and the leaders will lose the respect of the population and the moral authority to govern. So we argue, sometimes we argue fiercely but we should not take that as a sign that we are not open. Openness doesn't mean just lovey-dovey. Openness means being prepared to be candid, to be direct and to discuss very serious things very seriously.
So I give you the example of mr brown's column in Today. Some of you may have read it, some of you may not. But it hit out wildly at the government and in a very mocking and dismissive sort of tone. So MICA replied. How can you not reply? And some Singaporeans feel we were too harsh, we should have been gentler or may be just even accepted it. It’s just niceness. He didn’t mean us any harm.
Well, my view is like this. Mr brown is a very talented man. In fact, he is Mr Lee Kim Mun. If you listen to hispodcasts, they are hilarious. And he is entitled to his views and entitled to express them. But when he takes on the government and makes serious accusations, as he did in this case, because he said the government suppressed information before the elections which was awkward and only let it out afterwards. Then the government has to respond. Firstly, to set the record straight and secondly, to signal that this is really not the way to carry on a public debate on national issues and especially not in the mainstream media.
So we are moving forward. I would say whatever the risks in this new world, whatever the uncertainties, we have to press on, move ahead open up. You cannot freeze in the headlights, take fright and just stop in your tracks. You will be run over. You have to keep on moving forward, open up and this basic approach cannot change. We don’t have all the answers. We don't know what all the risks are. We are feeling our way forward step by step as Deng Xiaoping used to say mo zhe shi zi guo he (摸着石子过河), looking for stone at a time as you cross the river. So we will take it step by step in an orderly way. We don’t expect everybody to agree all the time. In fact, if we all agree all the time, something must be wrong with us. So you don’t want everybody to be singing the same note but at least we should be in the same room and if we are playing music, then you should be playing jazz and improvising and it should be, we’re each saying different things, but it blends together and it's a Singapore tone, Singapore tune and Singapore moves forward and that's the way we should be in the digital age.
Because our people are all over the world and because we are bringing in people from all over the world and because of the digital age, bombarding us with new ideas, and all kinds of new communications, it becomes all the more important that we strengthen our heartware, our emotional ties which bind Singaporeans to Singapore and to one another. It’s critical in this age. You may be more connected than ever but to be connected as a people, as one Singapore, as four million of us, I think that's something which we have to make the effort to do. How do we get Singaporeans to feel this? To feel that we are Singaporean, that we belong here. We are not just some citizens in cyberspace, passports issued by the Republic of Cyberspace. I think you have to do it in many ways. First, we have to tell the Singapore story and we must know the Singapore story.
This year, several of our first generation leaders passed away. Mr Lim Kim San recently, Mr Rajaratnam in February and last December, Mr Devan Nair. We had commemorations for the events. Many Singaporeans didn't know these people, what they had done. They didn't know that Mr Rajaratnam wrote the pledge or that Mr Lim Kim San was the reason that we all have homes in HDB flats. This is a new generation and we have to get them to know so that you will feel and from feeling, then you will belong and understand the core part of the Singapore story, how we got here. So I think parents and grandparents have a role to play. You have to tell the stories to your children, to your grandchildren to know not only what happened but how you feel about it, to feel that this is their story and to continue to want to write this story into the next chapter and the next volume.
The schools have a lot to do with this because when you go to school, you are not just learning facts orknowledge, you are also learning how to become a Singaporean. So 10 years ago, we launched a programme which we called the National Education programme in 1997. I met some teachers recently. I asked them “What’s happened? You are teaching the kids. Are you making progress?” They said, “Yes, we are making progress. We are doing well, we believe in this and we are passionate about it. But don’t please call it National Education because the kids will switch off because they will think it is a book subject to mug”. It is not a mugging subject. It is something you want people to feel, to develop, to feel and sense as a community. So, we have kids who go overseas and do projects in other countries and come back and they know why Singapore is different. We have kids who do projects in our own community. They help hospice patients, they come back, they know there are others in the community less fortunate than them who need help. Through all these activities, they will build character, resilience, they will develop leadership, team spirit and they will feel that this is their Singapore and this is what they must take care of. How do I know we have made progress? If I give an exam, I won’t know because if they give me the right answer, it maybe they studied the right question. But if you see that they do, what they, how they expressed themselves, how they lived, I think you can see that something has sunk home. Recently, we had a project to get students to do some little movies about social cohesion about Singapore. And the students surprised us with the results. They were outstanding and I’d like to show you just two of the movies. The first one is about a little lump of clay.
Not bad. I’ll show you a second one, this is sand art. So, it is a little bit subtle, you have to watch carefully. See if you can spot the skydivers.
CHIJ St Joseph’s Convent - the girls are here. I think they did well. It shows the new generation has got something special. They understand, they feel and they also got the digital age skills to do it. So, I think that we are getting somewhere in schools. But heartware isn’t just something we do in schools. It is also about getting all Singaporeans and to engage and participate in shaping the character and the life of our society. To feel passionately about something in our country, to get together to do something about it and work something out for the community. And this is happening at all levels. It is not something which the government can force or direct but we can foster it and we can allow it to happen and when it happens, I think we can recognize it and celebrate it. I just give you three small examples. One, is a group of young people in West Coast,Iswaran’s area, who got together after the Boxing Day Tsunami to help people in Aceh. They got together, they got organized. I think there are 50 or 60 of them altogether. They went to Aceh, they helped to rebuild a primary school, they came back. I think another group went. Altogether now they have done several rotations of people and new young people joined in and flow. They have done two primary schools and one community radio station and in the process they have made friends with one another.  In fact I hear two of them after getting into the project, fell in love and got married. So, it is not directed by us. We help them but they got organized, they delivered them. They did something which they felt was worth doing together with other Singaporeans.
We have got people who care passionately about the environment. A few years ago, Tanjung Chek Jawa.They got organised and they persuaded Mah Bow Tan to save Tanjung Chek Jawa and persuaded the Cabinet too. But they continued to work.
There is a Waterways Watch Society in Singapore. It is founded by a retired banker, Mr Eugene Heng and they are a group of volunteers and on weekends they cruise along the Kallang River or the Singapore River and make sure that it is clean and watch out for anybody who maybe littering. And they are also working with the schools to raise awareness. For example, St. Andrews School has adopted that segment of the KallangRiver which flows past the school and they can use it for water sports. It’s purely for the community but they feel strongly about it. They devote time to it and you need people like this, if you are going to have a Marina Bay which is beautiful and clean and which we will all be able to enjoy. So that is another example.
We have young people, who are now devoting their time to alumni matters. Our university graduates, when they graduate, now they donate, they help the university organize things. SMU, recently one young man fresh out of university, just started working, Mr Darren Lim and he has decided that he will donate part of his salary every year back to the university to fund part of a scholarship for one accountancy student because he feels grateful and he would like others to come along. So, it is the principle. He benefited from what others have planted before him and he is going to plant something and leave a legacy for the next generation. A way of thanking his parents for giving him an education.
So, these are the ingredients of heartware. They are individuals pieces, they are not all organized top down plans but they show people who care, they show people who are doing things and they show people who will get together and will feel that Singapore is a place where I did these things and I belong because I contributed and I made it happen and I made it different.
These are some of the key issues that will affect Singapore’s future in a rapidly changing world. What will Singapore be like 10 or 15 years from now? We can’t tell because it depends on what happens in the outside world. The outlook is bright but there are risks and there are bound to be surprises. But we know what we are aiming for and we are going to do our best to get it. We are aiming for an economy which will bring good job, good jobs from people who are senior citizens, who learn to operate a washing machine in a hawker centre, to a fund manager who is servicing clients around the world. We will have an economy which creates opportunities for people, to fulfil their dreams to pursue what they believe in, to create something new, to make their own lives better and make the lives of their fellow men better. We will be a society with an outstanding living environment. First class whether it is HDB or private, something where all the amenities are there, where the community feels at home, where if you are old or disabled, you can get around, there will be lifts on every floor and good amenities for all and we will have education, first-class education to prepare people for the digital age and make sure that all of us are on the top side of the rich-poor divide. And everyone of us has skills, everyone of us would be able to make a living for ourselves and pursue many paths to success. We will be an open, inclusive society where we all have a place, where we can all contribute, we all care for one another as one people and one nation, whatever our race, religion or background. These are ambitious goals but I think we can achieve them. We have what it takes. I think if we make up our minds we will get there. We have the energy, the drive the spirit and we will do something special for ourselves.
You have all been watching World Cup recently. Let me tell you three Singapore World Cup stories. One isShamsul Maidin. He was a footballer in the Police team. He found he had a talent as a referee. He went and refereed four World Cup games and was voted the Best World Cup referee on ESPN. I think we are proud of him.
There is a Robot World Cup. You may not have heard of it. It’s held in Germany also. It is a competition between robots which have been trained to play soccer. We have been champions, world champions for three years. And the team, the team is from Nanyang Polytechnic and is led by a lecturer, Mr Leong Kum Cheong.
Even in cooking we have World Cup. And our cooks do well. Last year our chefs went to a culinary world masters in Basel in Switzerland and came first. This year Executive Chef Randy Chow and his team are going to be competing in the Culinary World Cup in Luxembourg. We haven’t won yet but we wish them well.
Ours is an improbable nation. We are a small country in an uncertain world. We always worry about the future. We never take anything for granted. Many people have put heart and soul into building what we have today. And through hard work and clear thinking, we have created something unique and something precious in Singapore, a home for all of us. Our forefathers have planted the trees which now provide the shade which we now enjoy. It is now our duty to plant trees and grow them. Trees which would give hope and strength to a new generation and you should do this stuff because you happen to be born here or because you happen to hold the red passport. But because you believe in this mission, you believe in this ideal. You believe that Singapore is something special and worth fighting for. As Mr Rajaratnam said once, “because being Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry but of conviction and choice”.
This is one of the most exciting and hopeful times in the history of Asia and in fact in the history of Singapore. Many opportunities are opening up. But the demands would be very different and greater than what we have faced before. We can make these challenges and succeed, provided we have the courage and spirit, make the change, adapt, sacrifice, fight together and win. Make this a land of opportunity and give our children a bright future in a rapidly changing world.
Thank you very much.
We will be an open, inclusive society where we all have a place, where we can all contribute, we all care for one another as one people and one nation, whatever our race, religion or background. These are ambitious goals but I think we can achieve them. We have what it takes.PM Lee Hsien Loong

   singaporewebsite update april",12696,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the nation's future amidst global changes, focusing on five key areas: economy, regional dynamics, population, digital transformation, and societal cohesion (""heartware""). He emphasized the need for Singapore to adapt both individually and collectively to maintain long-term growth and prosperity.

1. **Economy**: Singapore has experienced robust economic growth, surpassing its long-term growth targets. The government aims to capitalize on favorable conditions to bolster economic resilience against potential downturns. Significant investments, such as the Integrated Resorts and major manufacturing projects by multinational corporations like Shell and Exxon Mobil, underscore confidence in Singapore's economic environment. Additionally, the government is prioritizing Research and Development (R&D) in sectors like biomedicine, water technology, and digital media to foster innovation and maintain competitive advantages.

2. **Regional Stability and Development**: The PM highlighted the importance of regional stability and developments in ASEAN countries, acknowledging both opportunities and challenges. Singapore's prosperity is closely linked to the economic and political climate of neighboring countries and broader Asia.

3. **Population and Talent Management**: Addressing demographic challenges, the PM discussed strategies to maintain a robust population, including fostering strong ties with overseas Singaporeans, encouraging higher birth rates, and actively attracting foreign talent to sustain economic vitality and cultural diversity.

4. **Digital Transformation**: Singapore is embracing the digital age, integrating technology into various sectors and ensuring that all citizens, including the elderly and lower-income groups, are digitally connected. This transformation is seen as crucial for future economic opportunities and societal engagement.

5. **Societal Cohesion (""Heartware"")**: The PM stressed the importance of strengthening societal cohesion and national identity through community engagement and education. Initiatives to engage citizens in meaningful activities that contribute to societal well-being are vital for fostering a sense of belonging and community spirit.

Overall, PM Lee's speech outlined a comprehensive strategy for Singapore's development, focusing on economic resilience, regional cooperation, population management, technological advancement, and societal cohesion to navigate the challenges of a rapidly changing global landscape."
2007,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, Singapore is on the move, things look good. There’s growing buzz and confidence in the air and our overall outlook is positive. The environment externally is also favourable. There’s optimism all over Asia. In recent weeks, you will have seen turbulence in the financial markets globally. This may affect the US and the European economies and, in that case, it will also affect Asia over the next three to six months. But even it if does, the fundamentals for Asia remain strong and so too for Singapore.
ASEAN countries benefit from a strong Asia and from high energy prices. Singapore has taken over as Chairman of Asean for this year. We are focusing on making Asean stronger and more integrated so that we can keep pace as China and India move ahead. Then we can be part of this growth and will not be left behind. Our relations with Malaysia and Indonesia are good. We are cooperating with them in many areas on a win-win basis. We have some issues with both countries outstanding. You know about them. But we will deal with these issues in the broader context of our overall relationship, focusing on growth and progress for Singapore and for Asean.
Singaporeans are all over Asia, in fact, all over the world — Southeast Asia, China, India, the Middle East, Central Asia. Even in Mongolia, we have a brewery making beer and in Brazil, we have a shipyard making oil rigs, doing very well. This is the way to thrive in a globalised world, but we’ve first got to secure our home base. Create the conditions for Singapore to grow, give every citizen a stake in the country’s success, create a sense of security and hope, and build a nation which we can all draw strength from and a home base from which we can venture forth and seize the opportunities all around us.
To do that, we have to adapt and change. Not just once, but again and again as the world around us changes. We have to change to make our economy more vibrant and competitive, which is what we have been doing, restructuring the economy, reforming the taxes, lowering income taxes, pushing up GST, developing the Integrated Resorts, remaking our city – all to make Singapore grow. We need changes to strengthen our social cohesion, to draw us closer together despite the tidal pull of external forces which threaten to pull us apart along race and religion, along rich and poor, between winners and losers. We must never let this happen. If we can stay together, then we make Singapore our home base where we all belong. And this is the way for us to sustain our exceptional performance. This is why we’re here today, because we have made these changes. So, we’re sitting in a strong position. We can tackle all the difficult problems which come our way, however difficult they may be, and we can move forward as one nation.
Tonight, I will focus on one major challenge for Singapore, which is the widening income gap and discuss several issues which are related to this — education, the ageing population and housing. We know why the income gap is widening. We have discussed this many times, you’ve read all about it in the papers — globalisation, technology and cut-throat competition. This is the way the world is going and Singapore is getting carried along with it. So, if we look at the spectrum, at the lower end, hundreds of millions of unskilled workers in China, India, Vietnam and there will be other countries, too, entering the global workforce holding down wages. In the middle to higher end, where you have skills — secretaries, clerks, professionals — IT is automating simple jobs. You don’t need a typist anymore, you need an office manager. So, the premium is on education and skills. Simple things, the computer or the robots can do. If you’re competing against a robot, you’re in trouble. You have to have skills and the ability to do things which the computers and robots cannot do.
So, the premium on education has gone up sharply. Somebody did a study in Singapore and we found that for every year longer you go to school, you can expect your wages to go up by 14 per cent. So, six years in school, then when you go to poly or university, the increase is even steeper per year of education. So, the premium on education is very high and the ladder is there and it’s steepening. But this goes all the way to the top and at the very top of the distribution, there’s fierce competition. In all fields — in sports, if you want to watch golf, you want to see Tiger Woods. Or if you want to watch tennis, you want to see Roger Federer. They are the best. If you are a company hiring a CEO, you want the best candidate and you will try very hard to get the best candidate because the second-best candidate, if he costs your company half-a- per cent in profits, for a big company, that may be several million dollars. So, you try hard to get the best. If you’re looking for a lawyer to fight your legal case for you, you will want to go for the best lawyer, not the cheapest one.
So, the result is winner takes all. The top incomes are zooming up, and the gap between the top and the second highest incomes is widening. So, it’s not just between the top and the middle but even at the top, it’s stretching out. Tiger Woods earns US$100 million a year — prizes and endorsements. The Number Two player in the world — most people here won’t know who’s the Number Two player in the world, which is the point — he’s Jim Furyk. He earns much less. And the Number Two earner in the world, who’s Phil Mickleson, he earns about half of Tiger Woods. So, even at the top, between Number One and Number Two, the gap widens — the best and the rest.
So, at the bottom, in the middle, at the top, incomes are stretching out, but there’s one more reason why income gap worries us and that is the ageing population. Many of the poor people are likely to be elderly and even working people who are not poor, if they’ve not provided enough for their old age, when they retire and they have no source of income, when their savings run out, they will become poor and will face difficulties.
So, this is what’s happening to us. It’s happening all over the world to developed economies. What can we do about it? The first overall strategy is to grow our economy, generate the resources to tackle these problems to help those in need. Without resources, you can talk, you can sympathise, you can feel the pain, you can’t solve the problem. Ageing is a very difficult problem to solve. There are no easy solutions, but I’ll talk about this later at length. For the income distribution, at the lower end, we emphasize training, skills upgrading, job redesign, so as to raise the productivity of low-income workers, get them to be able to do better paying jobs, help them to earn more and this is what NTUC is doing through job redesign. In addition to this, we have programmes like Workfare where we transfer to the low income, but not without conditions, as a hongbao. On condition you work, you make the effort, well, I am prepared to match you and I will help to top up your savings a little bit towards your take-home pay. If you make the effort, we will help make your life better.
So, at the bottom we have a strategy. At the top, it’s good that people are doing well. The incomes may look large, but we cannot hold these incomes down. Nor can we levy higher income taxes to tax them away because if you try to do that, particularly in a small and open country likeSingapore, the talent will leave, the economy will lose vitality, and many others will suffer. And right now, we are prospering because we have brought income taxes down, because we have welcomed talent, because we have attracted businesses which come here and thrive in Singapore. So, they’ve done well for themselves and our economy has boomed — 110,000 jobs created first half of this year.
But although we can’t force the incomes down or tax them away, those who have succeeded have to show that they care for their fellow citizens, for example, through philanthropy. It’s happening in the US. A lot of the new wealth, people who are rich, instead of just spending it or living extravagant lifestyles, they’re setting up foundations, doing good work. And here, too, many Singaporeans are donating generously to good causes. So, our universities, NUS, NTU, SMU, they have received contributions, donations for endowments to many projects and the universities have a scheme to have endowed professorships – professorships named after people and we’ve they’ve collected contributions widely. Groups have mobilized in order to pass the hat around and between the universities, they have nearly 80 endowed professorships. I think the contributions add up to a few hundred million dollars.
So, Singaporeans have been making these donations, small ones and a few big ones, too. Sometimes, we have buildings and faculties named after the donors or after the foundations. So, we have the Lee Kong Chian School of Business in SMU. NUS has the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and we’ve got hospitals named after people — Tan Tock Seng, from long ago, recently, the Khoo Teck Puat Foundation has made a very generous donation. So, Yishun will have the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital coming up soon. Others like Mr Sim Wong Hoo have also made generous donations. More people should do this according to your means and from your heart because collectively, these individual responses make our society much more compassionate, much more cohesive.
In the middle of the income distribution, for the vast majority of Singaporeans, our policies must enable them to do well and provide them with many opportunities to move ahead along many paths. One major strategy is home ownership through the HDB. It’s the best form of social welfare for citizens because it gives every Singaporean a stake in Singapore’s success. I have some new plans for HDB which I will show you later.
Another major strategy is education. I told you just now how the payoff on education is going up and, therefore, this is the best way to level up our society. Our aim is to give every child a top-rate education. Therefore, our emphasis is on the quality of all our schools in Singapore, including all of the neighbourhood schools and not just on a few top schools. We’re building a high base in all these schools, but they’re not all the same. We want each one to develop its own special area of expertise and have its own passion, its own approach.
MOE has worked hard at this. I would say they have given you four “more” things. First “more’ — freedom for principals and teachers to experiment. So, you can try out new ideas. Second “more” — resources for schools with good ideas, so that if you succeed, well, we will help you build on that success. Third “more” — opportunities for needy students through the Opportunity Funds. And fourth “more” is more learning, less teaching.
When we first talked about more learning, less teaching, or teach less, learn more, skeptics asked, “I’m sure you will teach less, are you sure they will learn more?” But we can see it happening now because there’s tremendous energy and enthusiasm in many schools. I talked to Tharman, and I visited some of these schools recently to see for myself. I’ll tell you about two of them.
One is Jurong Secondary School in Taman Jurong. The students showed me many projects, but the one which I’ll share with you is their DVD. It’s not a disc, it’s what they do — Digital Video and Drama. Secondary school students.They learn, they master the skills, then they use this in their language classes. So, I attended a CL class, Chinese language, Sec Two. The teachers had assigned the students to read a novel. The novel was “Xiao Wang Ji”, “The Little Prince”. In fact, it’s a French novel, but they read the Chinese version of it for a holiday assignment. After reading the novel, the students wrote a script. Then the students acted it out in the Digital Video Studio. So, complete with mikes, blue screen behind. So, you can put anything you like, not just a fixed screen like this one down here, and the students managed the cameras, the students managed the monitors, the students controlled everything. After that, they made the video, the class watched the acting and the performance. Then they interviewed the actors, which are their classmates and they asked the actors, “Why did you do this? Why did you trust that man? Why did you draw this picture” and so on and discussed what they learned in Mandarin. It’s not bad. I spent two hours with the school. The students interviewed me in front of the blue screen. I felt quite nervous! Before I left, they presented me with a DVD. This is Jurong Secondary School. I think there are many others like that.
Then, I went to a primary school, Mayflower Primary School in Ang Mo Kio. Actually, it’s in Yio Chu Kang, Seng Han Tong’s ward now, but used to be Ang Mo Kio. I went to open it about 2000, came back to see what happened. Some of the old teachers were still there. The teachers were focused not just on grades, but on character, moral values, social skills. They’ve got the students to work in groups. So, all of the classrooms, you don’t see rows of desks and chairs. You see clusters of desks and chairs and parent volunteers involved for many of the programmes actively. This is Mayflower Primary School in the heartlands.
The teachers are full of spirit and passion. They’re committed to teaching every child. They have conviction and pride in what they’re doing. How do I know? Because several of them have school-age children and they’ve put their children into Mayflower Primary School and you can see the difference in the children. So, I didn’t quiz the children, I quizzed the teachers. I decided to ask them, I said, “In Singapore, students are famous for staying quiet in class and they never speak up. Have you been able to get the students to speak up?” I was greatly cheered by the reply because the reply was,“The problem is how to get them to stop talking”. So, they had a solution — group work, one student wears a badge, “Noise Manager”.
They put up a full-scale musical, “Our Time To Shine”.I saw them rehearsing. I didn’t watch the musical, but Seng Han Tong attended the musical just before National Day and he emailed me. It moved him to email me because I’ve said in my message that we will have a new Singapore with our own unique identity and a “can-do, never-say-die” spirit. So, Seng Han Tong heard my message and he sent me this message after watching the show – “It was by our very own Ang Mo Kio heartland neighbourhood school, Mayflower Primary School that has the same spirit of “can-do and never-say-die”. I felt very proud to see many of Ang Mo Kio little boys and girls performing confidently on the stage. They acted professionally, they sang happily and they danced gracefully. I turned my head back and encountered many familiar faces. These are the parents and grandparents who might not believe that one day, their children and grandchildren could perform so well on the big stage. I saw smiling and proud faces all around. It was indeed an occasion that made one realize that Singapore is a City of Possibilities.”
Many more exciting things are happening in schools all over Singapore, but this is our fundamental approach to uplift all Singaporeans. Whichever school you go to, whatever your home background, we will help you develop your talents to the full. The ladders are steep, but we will provide you many ladders to success and help you climb up as high as you can. All this depends on a very high quality teaching force, good teachers, principals, MOE staff, dedicated and passionate about teaching and this is what we have and this is what our future depends on. There are 28,000 teachers and principals in Singapore. I can’t bring them all into this hall, but I’ve invited a few here tonight to represent all 28,000 of them and I would like them to stand, so we can salute you.
Before I move on, I’d like to talk about just one aspect of our school education and that is language skills. Many older Singaporeans can understand and speak Malay and Bahasa Indonesia, including many older non-Malays, but in the younger generation, there are too few It’s because we’ve made English the lingua franca and don’t live in kampongs. We live in HDB flats and our mingling is in English. But we need more people to be familiar with the languages, maybe not totally fluent, but to chit-chat, and understand the gist without translation. So, you can ""cakap-cakap"", a bit more advanced, ""bual-bual"". If you’re in Indonesia, at least ""obrol"". I think that’s the right word. Then we can interact with our neighbours in their language, work together on opportunities and deal with whatever issues that arise from time to time.
We’re not changing our mother tongue policy, but we must encourage more non-Malays to learn Malay in addition to their mother tongue.Therefore, we’re going to have two new initiatives in our secondary schools. First, the Malay Special Programme to study Malay as a third language. It’s there already in all the schools, but it’s not very popular. So, we’re going to introduce incentives to encourage more students to do the Malay Special Programme. Singaporeans like incentives, so we’re going to have small incentives — two bonus points for JC admission and a few more things. Similarly, we’ll have the incentives for non-Chinese students who are doing the Chinese Special Programme, in other words, Chinese as a third language, and hopefully, more non-Chinese will take that up, too.
We will also introduce a Regional Studies Programme in a few secondary schools, that means probably three or four of them; good schools. We will offer scholarships for this programme, probably about 100 a year. So, what will be in the Regional Studies Programme? First, the Malay Special Programme — learn Malay as a third language. Secondly, also learn about Southeast Asian neighbours and you can have immersion visits, exchanges and so on. It would be good if one of the schools can offer Bahasa Indonesia instead of Malay and from our preliminary soundings, it looks like there will be one school which is interested.
Beyond the schools, we aim to get every student into post-secondary education and as many as possible into tertiary institutions. We’ve invested very heavily in our ITE, in our polytechnics, in our universities. I’ve shown you some of the things they’ve been doing. I’ll give you a little more this evening. Because of our investments, we’ve increased the intakes year by year and we’ve increased the upgrading — more students progressing from ITE to poly, more students going from poly to university, more students going into the entire post-secondary and tertiary sector. And with good schools, more and more students want to go up and want to go to university. So, this year, particularly, if you’ve been reading the newspapers, you will see that many parents and many students fretted about their university admission. They’ve got reasonable grades, maybe even above average, but not quite good enough to get into the subjects in the university which they wanted to. So, they blamed it on dragon babies, but it’s not because of dragon babies. Firstly, the dragon was very small; secondly, even with more dragon babies, we actually expanded the university intake more than proportionately so that a bigger proportion go to university this year than last year. But, of course, an even bigger proportion wants to go, who couldn’t get into the places they want and so, the anxieties are still there.
I think there are also many polytechnic graduates who hope to go on to get degrees. Right now, about 15 per cent of the poly graduates go on to NUS or NTU or SMU and there are many more who are getting degrees by other routes, including many who go abroad. Our estimate is maybe half the poly students eventually get a degree, in fact, quite soon after graduation and some of them go abroad because we don’t have enough places in Singapore. One MP, Matthias, told me – he visited house-to-house, met a couple who were a bit sore because their two kids did well in poly, then they sent them overseas to Australia for university education. They graduated, now they’re working there, they haven’t come back. So, two old folks alone at home, feeling bereft in an empty nest. I think there must be many more parents like that. So, we should expand our university places in Singapore, but we should not just do it heedlessly, willy-nilly. We should make sure that students get a good education and are equipped with valuable skills which are going to be useful to them.
We have to be careful because some countries have produced large numbers of graduates without regard for either the quality or the employment opportunities. Lots of universities, some of them paper printing machines and so, they face big problems — graduates unemployed or under-employed. It’s better not to have graduated but to have a good job than to have graduated with a skill which is not useful and then you spend your time feeling unhappy.
Today, in Singapore, nearly one-quarter of every cohort get subsidised education in our three state-funded universities, NUS, NTU, SMU. We aim to raise this now to 30 per cent of the cohort in publicly-funded universities by 2015. We set a new target — from now to 2015, we have eight years, we will push it up from the current 23 per cent to 30 per cent and this means we will have 2,400 more university places every year for our students. This also means that we should build a fourth publicly-funded university. I see Prof Lim Pin, the old vice-chancellor, smiling in the audience. But I think it is the right thing to do because the existing universities are already rather large. We shouldn’t expand them further. We need to develop a new fourth institution with its own character, unique strengths, different from NUS or NTU or SMU; just as when SMU came along, it was not just NUS or NTU, but something different and now, it has got its own character and its own pulling power.
We may not limit ourselves to just one new institution. We could open more than one route. I’ve asked Lui Tuck Yew to chair a committee to study how we can expand the university sector. I’ve also found him an adviser to the committee, who is Dr Tony Tan, and we will decide within a year on the best way to proceed. With these changes in our schools and higher education, Singaporeans can look forward to more opportunities to receiving a first-class education — more pathways to success.
Another factor in our widening income gap is our ageing population. We have one of the fastest ageing populations in the world. Why? Reason number one - not enough babies. I’m not discussing this anymore tonight. Nike says, “Just Do It”. But the second reason is Singaporeans are living longer. I had a conversation sometime ago with Father Michael Arro. He’s a Roman Catholic priest in the Church of St Teresa. Some of you may know him, a very nice old gentleman. He’s been here a long time. He came from France to Singapore 50 years ago. He told me this, he said, when he first came to Singapore, his parishioners would retire at 55 and he would conduct the funeral services around the age of 60. So, about five, six years after they retired, well, they passed on. Now, he said, people retire at 62 and they live till about 80, which means about 20 years of retirement. Father Arro was spot on because after I talked to him, I went to look up the statistics and in 1957, 50 years ago, the average life expectancy in Singapore was just 61 years old. Today, the average life expectancy is 80 years old and many people will live longer than 80, to 90 or 100 and beyond.
So, I looked up some more statistics — 90 and above, do you know how many people? 9,000 in Singapore. 100 and above? MM said “few dozens”. So, I went to check. Vast underestimate. There were 500 people, aged 100 and above. I asked the registry, “Are you sure your records are up to date?” They said, “Yes, we check from time to time”. So, recently on CNA, you may have watched a programme “The New Old”. It featured a lady, Sister Teresa Hsu, social worker, 110 years old, still walking, still active, still visiting some of her old needy people whom she was helping. And she’s not the oldest. There are some people who are older than her in Singapore. So, I said, what about people who are 120 years old? So, the staff told me, we don’t know because when you reach 120, the computer assumes that you forgot to report something and transfers you to a different file. But one day, there may well be somebody who is 120 years old and we’ll have to change our computer programme.
The CNA programme, “The New Old”, also showed Professor Anne Wee, aged 81. She’s here with us this evening. I invited her here because of something she said. She says, “I describe myself as an OPWA — an Old Person With Attitude. I drive, I work, I go to see students, I take care of my garden, my life, I’m fully alive to the world”. And she said she aimed for a rectangular life and she explained — a happy and meaningful life for as long as you live and when the time comes, let it be fast and painless. So, the aim is not to live forever but to have a good life and a good death — what the Hokkiens in Singapore call “ho see” (好死). It’s a reality which we have to face.
The Japanese have the same philosophy. They look for three major components of a happy life — ample eating, leisurely sleeping and a quick death — and they have special temples where people go to pray for this. It’s called “pokkuri dera” — temples which bless longevity and painless death and these “pokkuri dera” are very popular in Japan. So, the next time I go to Japan, I’ll visit one.
What will Singapore be like, say, in 2020? To find out, I visited Radin Mas — Sam Tan’s ward. Radin Mas has 17 per cent of its population aged 65 and above, one in six. Singapore, as a whole, is around one in 12, but by 2020, Singapore will be like Radin Mas, one in six. So, I went for a preview. I’ll show you some pictures of the preview. These are some of the people I met in Radin Mas, old folks celebrating a birthday party which the grassroots organises for them once a month, having a good time. If you add up their years on stage, I think it’s quite a big number. They stay active. The RC ogranises many activities, this one they’re doing ""wai dan gong"", so shivering away, but not just exercise, also socialising, keeping in touch with each other.
Sam Tan organised and just started a Project Golden Service because he found all these old folks and wanted to help them to pick up skills, to do something useful and earn some pocket money. So, they did very interesting things – calligraphy, others doing haircuts. This one, a very fancy ketupat and the next one, two old ladies stitching quilts in their 70s. I asked them, “Where do you do this?"" They said, go down to the old folks centre, they speak Cantonese. So, I said, ""You go down to sew the quilts?"" So, they said, ""No, no, we go down. First, we ""keng-gai, keng-gai"" — that means chit-chat with our friends, socialise — then afterwards, we can sew a quilt"". They don’t really need to make the quilt, but it’s something productive and useful for them to do together.
I also met a few and talked with a few other ladies. Two of them are here. The one in the middle, this one in black and red, is an old resident of mine from Teck Ghee. I had helped her. So, when I went down, she came down to say hello to me. She had had a rough time. She had been unwell, she’d had back problems, spinal operation, wheelchair-bound. Then, when she moved to Radin Mas, she joined a religious group, she made friends, chants and meditates daily, exercises, regained her strength. Now, she’s walking again with a walking stick, as you can see. But she’s active again and she said, “I have something to look forward to, chatting with my friends, thinking of new things to do, all the time getting stronger”. But she asked me one very sharp question. She said, “My CPF runs out this year. What happens after that?” She’s 68 years old. So, I told her “man man lei” -— slowly, we are working on this problem, which we will talk about later.
The other lady, you will not believe, Madam Lee Siew Lan. How old is she? She’s 91. She’s still working as a cleaner in Redhill Market. How did she get the job? She was friends with the hawkers, and hawkers introduced her to the cleaning contractor. So, courtesy of NTUC’s job redesign programme, proper equipment, trolleys, garments and so on. So, she is productive. So, she told us, she says — she didn’t tell me this, she told Sam Tan this — she says officially, she earns $800, but actually, she moonlights a little bit, helping out hawkers cut vegetables, jaga the stalls, and she’s fiercely independent. She says, “When people give me free things, I don’t accept. Why, when I can afford to pay? But if they say, “Okay, you’re a friend, we give you a discount”, then I think okay, friends can accept kindness”. So, this is the spirit you want to, not just in 91-year-olds, but in 51-year-olds and 31-year-olds and 21-year-olds, too.
I also met Madam Loke Tai Hoe, the samsui lady. She’s chatting here with Lui Tuck Yew, who dressed to match! She came to Singapore — she is now 89-years-old. She came to Singapore when she was 18. Her husband came first, brought her over. She started working as a samsui woman, finished at about 60-plus, carried on working until she was 79. She brought up ten children. Husband has died now, so, she lives with four of her unmarried children in Radin Mas.
As Singaporeans grow older, we need to give them more help. In Radin Mas, the flats are fitted out for elderly living. So, you have the panic buttons and cables to call for help, flat floors, handle bars and so on and downstairs, there’s a VWO. So, social workers and RC volunteers will visit the old folks regularly, help them, look after them and all the old folks are very grateful. So, I talked to them individually and I asked them, “How do you manage?” and they all said, “Tak Kao, Tak Kao” because many of them are Cantonese. So, “Tak Kao” is “De Jiao” (德教). It means “Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society”, which is the VWO which is looking after them. So, it’s a tremendous sense of gratitude and obligation and sense that somebody cares and is looking after them. I was very happy to see that they’re active, healthy, cared for by the community, but I was also worried that more and more elderly are living by themselves because the best solution is still the family. Stay with your children or at least have children staying nearby who can visit regularly and who can help you with something if you need some help.
Radin Mas is a glimpse of our future. All wards have senior citizens like this. In fact, Radin Mas is not the oldest one. The oldest one is Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng, Lily Neo’s ward in Jalan Besar GRC and it has one in four residents above 65. Now, by 2020, all of us will have quite a lot more white hair and our whole society will have to make adjustments. The Government is very seized with this issue. Boon Heng is working on it full-time. I talked about this earlier in Chinese and covered several aspects, but there’s one more important aspect, which is savings for old age.
REACH — Amy Khor is now Chairman — did a consultation exercise on active ageing. They did many forums and they got lots of feedback and she distilled it down and sent me the report. Amongst all the different feedback, two thorny issues consistently came up. One was employment opportunities for older workers, in other words, working longer and, two, having sufficient funds for old age and that means CPF savings and I want to focus on these issues next.
The best way to be alright in old age and to have enough savings is to stay employed and to work longer because with longer life spans, you cannot retire at 55 and live until 80 or 85 or 90. As life spans go up, you have to work longer and then have not too long a period of retirement at the end of your life.
Countries around the world, US, UK, Japan, are trying to get their people to work longer and to receive state pensions later. Now, many of them are in their 60s or early 60s, they’re trying to push it to late 60s. In fact, they think that they have to push it all the way into 70s, or at least until 70, but it’s politically very difficult, it takes a very long time.
We also have to make this adjustment. We don’t expect Singaporeans all to work till their 80s and 90s, like Madam Lee and Madam Loke, but to retire at 55 or even at 62 is too early. Lim Swee Say told us this story – he’s not here tonight, he’s rushing home from America and his flights got disrupted because of bad weather, so he sends his apologies, but he told us this story and, like Jurong Secondary School, I made a little script out of it. So, I will read this. Lim Swee Say on a walkabout, he said, “I talked to a resident at the market. He was healthy-looking”. So, Lim Swee Say says, “How old are you?” Resident says, “72.” So, Lim Swee Say says, “Wow, you’re looking healthy for your age. Are you still working?” So, Resident says, “No, I retired a long time ago when I was 55.” So, Lim Swee Say says, “55! Why did you retire so young?” and the Resident says, “Because I didn’t know I was going to live so long!”
So, our challenge is how to get more people in their 60s working. I discussed this with the union leaders and this is also their foremost concern, how to get more people working because they tell me the workers themselves want to continue working and are putting pressure on the union leaders to work out arrangements with the employers and I think this is a tremendous plus, that they do want to work, but we need to enable them to do this and to enable more of them to do this. But how do we do that? I think that in Singapore, there are three ways — education, legislation and incentives.
Well, let me start about education, just briefly because I’ve talked a lot about this before. We have to change mindsets for both the employers and the workers. We’ve got to get the employers to recognise the value of older workers, deploy them effectively and make the most of their abilities and strengths. Enlightened employers are starting to do this, like SBS Transit is hiring back some retired bus drivers as service mentors to guide the new drivers. The workers also have to adjust and they have to be prepared to change gears after 62, to accept lower pay and lighter work, to accept lower appointments so that younger ones can move up because otherwise, if you have the oldest ones at the most senior jobs, then our whole system will be like a mountain with greyer and greyer hair at the top of the mountain and that’s not the way to be full of dynamism and vibrancy. So, companies like SingPower — they have Senior Technicians, they retire, they’re re-employed as Technicians, so somebody else can be promoted to be Senior Technicians, can move up. So, education is the first step.
The second step is legislation, to send a clear signal to employers and to the public and to the workers that we’re serious about this that this is a major problem for us and we have to do something about it. People often ask, “Why don’t we just pass the law, raise the retirement age? Just straightforward, you just pass a law. What the Government says will happen”. But our experience shows us that what the Government says, if you say it unwisely, may not happen and just raising the retirement age may not solve the problem and may even make it worse.
Today, the legal retirement age is 62, but not everybody works till 62. Among the women, many have left the workforce much earlier — 30s and 40s when they had children; when they set up their households, they dropped out of the workforce. Among the men, only two-thirds are working at 62. Two-thirds is not bad, but even then, one-third have retired before reaching 62 despite the legal retirement age. So, if we just raise the retirement age beyond 62, either it doesn’t work and people drop out anyway, or employers say, “This is going to be a burden to me. If I’m looking at an older worker, I better not take the risk of employing him and then I may be stuck with him till he’s 65”. So, I think we cannot just push the retirement age up.
The better approach which we are pursuing is to legislate for re-employment — retire at 62, but re-employ, continue working beyond 62, year to year, but continue working as long as you can. It’s more flexible for both the employers and the employees; not necessarily the same job, not necessarily the same pay. It doesn’t mean that you will definitely get a job, but employer has to make an offer and you take into account the worker’s performance, his health, his preferences and the company’s needs and both sides work out a win-win arrangement, usually year to year. This is what the Japanese have done, but they only took this step after a very long period of preparation and this is what we’re going to do also.
So, we’re going to pass a Re-Employment Act to take effect by 2012, in fact, 1 January 2012, and we will require employers to offer re-employment to workers to reach the retirement age, which is right now 62. As a first step, re-employment up to 65, then later, we push this up to 67. So, in other words, come 1 January 2012, the employers have to offer re-employment up to 65 years old.
So, that’s legislation, but to buttress the legislation, we’ll have incentives and the incentive should be to encourage older people to work and to encourage employers to hire older people, both sides. One tool which we now have to achieve this is Workfare — Workfare Income Supplement, which we introduced this year. With Workfare, there is a subsidy. So, if a person wants to work, and the employer wants to hire him, he gets the grant from the Government. We’ve already tilted Workfare in favour of older workers. When we designed it, we did it so that at 35 years old, you start getting something, and at 45 years old, you get the full rate. But we can go further than that and we can have further higher tiers for the older workers in their 50s and 60s to strengthen the incentive so that when the employer looks at the worker, he calculates, between the older man and the younger man, I think the older man has this extra little edge and between an older worker and a foreign worker — foreign worker, you pay levy, older worker, he gets Workfare. So, that’s an additional leg up for the older worker.
We had planned to introduce these additional tiers for the older workers when we review the Workfare scheme after a few years, after it has been implemented and we get some experience with it. But I think this year we’re making major changes, legislation, CPF — better not wait, let’s move now. So, we will push the Workfare up to have higher tiers for the older workers, starting above 55, up to double the payout for the younger workers. So, for example, a worker who’s 60 years old, earning $1,000 a month today, he will get $100 a month from Workfare today, same as a 45-year-old. It’s $1,200 a year, so $100 a month, ten per cent of the salary in Workfare. When we revise the scheme, we will double this to give him $200 a month. If he’s earning $1,000, it’s $200 a month, which is 20 per cent of his salary; not all in cash, some in CPF, but it will make a big difference because it will mean more take-home pay and more CPF contributions. It will encourage the employer to hire him and it will encourage him to go and work. These are good proposals which came up from the unions and which were recommended by the Tripartite Committee on the Employability of Older Workers which Gan Kim Yong chaired. We’re implementing them now. I think it will raise the employment rate for the older Singaporeans and help them to save more for old age and this is a core part of our programme to help old people take care of themselves.
Now, I come to CPF. The CPF system underpins our whole social security arrangements. It’s a very good system which has served us well. It’s funded by contributions from workers and from employers, fully funded and not paid for out of taxes, like social security in America or in Britain. So, each person saves for his own and provides enough for his old age. It meets three key needs — housing, medical, retirement — which are the three key things everybody has to think about. But we have to adjust and bring the CPF system up to date. When CPF started, life expectancy was 60, 61; now, it is 80 years old. So, we need to make three changes — firstly, improve the returns on the CPF savings. Secondly, draw down the CPF savings later so that they will last longer and thirdly, to cover the risks of living longer than expected.
The first question is how to increase the returns on the CPF savings? CPF pays interest. Right now, it’s 2.5 per cent on the Ordinary Account, four per cent on the rest — Special Account, Medisave Account, Retirement Account. Its interest rate is like a savings account in the bank, only it’s better. Interest rate is higher and it’s safer. It’s totally risk-free, balances guaranteed by the Government. Sometimes, the returns are lower than buying shares, but sometimes, shares can lose you a lot of money and on shares, you make big, you lose big and like recently, in one week you can see your value go down 10, 15 per cent. If all our CPF members were on the stock market, I think a lot of hearts will go “gedebok, gedebok” every night. So, it’s not part of our system. Those who want higher returns can accept higher risks, you can invest your CPF money yourself. We have ascheme, it’s called the CPF Investment Scheme. But although it’s called the CPF Investment Scheme, it means you invest your own money and take the risks.
I think we must improve the returns on the CPF and I think our main focus should be to help the lower- and the middle-income groups. In other words, the people who don’t have so much money in the CPF. How much money do they have? Well, if you look at the active accounts, people who are working and contributing regularly - half of the active accounts have $45,000 or less. It’s not a huge amount, but it does include younger workers just starting to save. So, understandably, they will have less. If we look at just the older workers, they have a bit more, but still, if you have $45,000 you are not poor. But I would not think it is wise to strongly encourage you to go and play the stock market. Why? First, you don’t have enough savings; secondly, you may not have the expertise; thirdly, you should not expose yourself to excessive risks and, in fact, quite a number of the people who have invested on their own and bought shares have not done so very well and probably would have done better if they had left the money in the CPF.
So, what should we do? I think the solution should be to enhance the existing risk-free framework for the CPF balances. We will have the CPF Board pay higher interest, but up to a cap. How much higher interest? One percentage point more. Where should we set the cap? We’ve studied this carefully. I think what we should do is to up to $20,000 in your Ordinary Account, but taking all your accounts together, up to $60,000. Combined – Ordinary, Special, Medisave, Retirement altogether – we will pay higher interest on $60,000. But not more than $20,000 of that should be in your Ordinary Account because the Ordinary Account is more liquid – you can use it for housing and so on. So, this way, more than half of the active members will get full benefit, one percentage point more on all of their balances. And you have these higher returns. You can still use your money for housing, you can still use your Medisave for medical expenses, but we will put one restriction. There has to be a catch there and the catch is you will not take out this part of the money to invest in the CPF Investment Scheme because this is long-term money and you leave it with us and we will treat it like retirement funds and we will give you the higher interest rate.
Beyond the $60,000, we keep the status quo. For the Ordinary Account, it’s the same formula as now. So, for the HDB loan rate, which I think all of you will be interested to know, will also be the same formula as now. For the Special Account, we are making adjustment to change the basis of the Special Account from the present one to a long-term rate. It will mean a little bit less now but probably more on average over the long term. But these are details which we will explain fully later. The main message is one percentage point more on up to $60,000.
If you have more than 60K, what do I say to you? I say if you have more than 60K, you should be able to look after yourself because you have accumulated this, and you should be able to invest your money beyond the first 60K. The CPFIS is there. Have a care, take good advice, invest it for the long term, but you have enough so that if it goes up a bit, down a bit from day to day, you don’t have to panic and if you take it over 5, 10, 15 years, well, you may be able to do a little bit better.
Now, one percentage point may not sound like a lot of money, but it makes a big difference. If you take a young men who starts to work today, 21-years-old, earning $1,700 a month and then over the years, he buys a four-room flat, so he draws down some of his CPF. But meanwhile, all the money in his CPF is accumulating higher interests, year by year, one per cent more, then compounded.over 35 years, by the time he retires at 55, that will mean he has $20,000 more interest than he would have earned under the present system. That means one-quarter more interest than before. It’s a lot of money. It’s going to cost the Government a lot of money. It’s going to cost the Government $700 million a year just for starters and over the next probably 10, 15 years, as the CPF balances increase, members save more, I think the balances attracting this high interest will grow and the cost for the Government will grow.
How much is this? $700 million year after year? Today, our HDB subsidy - Ministry of Finance pays HDB every year for that whole building programme is $750 million. So, this is like one more HDB scheme. But we’ve done our sums carefully to make sure that this is a reasonable rate to pay on CPF balances and it is a rate which the Government can afford because it’s most important. You cannot just suka-suka write any number. It must be properly justified and must pass muster and inspection by the Elected President, which is the way we have done it and we’ve briefed the President. It is the right thing to do, to help lower and middle-income Singaporeans to save enough for old age. And it’s a reassurance to everyone that when you grow old, the CPF will be one major pillar to help you see through your retirement needs.
So, that’s the first major change to the CPF, higher interest rate, subject to a cap and rules. The second question is how to make CPF savings last for your life expectancy, which means up to 80-years-old. Today, we already have some rules. At 55, you set aside the Minimum Sum, then you can take out the rest. Minimum Sum is going up. The rules for setting aside are getting tighter, but basically, you must aside the Minimum Sum. We settled this in the last round of CPF changes. So, my first message is – no change to the rules at 55 to what has already been settled. That remains. It was settled in 2003 and will continue. But right now, after you have put aside your Minimum Sum and put it into your Retirement Account, you start to draw down your Minimum Sum when you are 62-years-old. Monthly payments are supposed to last 20 years, but actually if you don’t have enough CPF, it may not last 20 years. So, 62 plus 20 is 82. So, 62-years-old is when you start to draw your Minimum Sum and that is called the Draw-Down Age for the minimum sum.
But is 62 the right age to start drawing down? I told you what Madam Ng said to me just now and her problem. She says, “What happens when my CPF runs out?” Even with a higher interest rate which we are paying, if we start drawing down the CPF too early, the money is going to run out too soon. If we start later, the Minimum Sum will last longer. You may think that 62 to 82 is long enough, but many people are going to live beyond 82. So, if we can push off the draw-down by one year at the front end, then that one year’s money which is saved and which stays in your CPF and accumulates interest, including plus one per cent for 20 years, by the time you reach the tail end of your 20 years, that will have multiplied and doubled. So, you’ll have two more years’ worth at the tail in order to last you longer. So, we have to make some adjustment to the draw down age because 82, on average, you may live that, but many will live beyond and I think especially many women will live beyond because the women’s life expectancy will be longer than the men’s life expectancy.
We are legislating for re-employment until 65. We are pushing hard for people to work into their 60s until 65. Therefore, Draw-Down Age should also go to 65 because you are working, you work till 65, when you stop working, probably at 65, then you start drawing down. If you can continue working beyond 65, well, then you get both. So, we will raise this Draw-Down Age from 62 to 65, but not in one shot – progressively over a number of years. In 2012, the Re-Employment Act will kick in and we will start to raise the Draw-Down Age in 2012 from 62 to 63 and then, every two years, we will push it up another one so it will reach 65 by 2018. So, that means if the Draw-Down Age is 65 and you draw it down over 20 years, 65 plus 20 means it lasts till you are 85-years-old, which I think is better.
How will these impact different age groups? First of all, those who are nearly 62-years-old and going to draw either tomorrow or next year, you are okay, we are not disturbing you. You will have made your plans, you may want to go on holiday, go ahead. But those who are slightly younger, that means 57-years-old and below, we will disrupt your plans just a little bit by one year. Those who are not approaching 62-years-old yet, that means 53 and below, I think you can take the full adjustment, we will push your Draw-Down Age up to 65. You have got nearly ten years to continue re-skilling and for us to change the laws, and make sure that when you get to that age it will be easier for you to find a job and work till 65. The press will carry the table tomorrow. I will not show you the table, but that is the gist of it.
I have explained this at length because I know that this is not so popular. As Straits Times did a survey last week abut CPF, they asked people, “Do you want higher CPF returns?” “Yes, CPF returns are too low”. “Do you want to work longer?” “Yes, we want to work longer”. “Are you worried about savings for retirement?” “Yes, I am very worried I may not have enough”. “So, how about delaying the Draw-Down Age?” Huge numbers said, “No!” They know the problem, but they want to draw down now. But we have no choice. People are living longer, we have to work longer and we have got to start drawing on our reserves later. Therefore, we have to start moving now; not move all the way now, but start moving now and we will get there in good time.
Of course, we also have some incentives in this and the Government knows that older workers are affected by this deferment in the Draw-Down Age – older workers meaning those who are in their 50s. So, we will give them something a little bit extra. We will pay a one-off bonus. In fact, we will have two kinds of one-off bonuses. One is a one-off bonus interest to pay into the Retirement Accounts of people whose Draw-Down Age has been pushed forward. So, from 62 to 63 to 64 to 65, if you are in the 50s age group and affected by that, we will give you what we call a “D-Bonus”, “D” for “Deferment”; one-off because we are only doing this once. But if you are not pushed to 65, if your Draw-Down Age is not pushed to 65 yet, but you think you can continue working and you are not desperate for the CPF money and you want to leave it till longer so that it will last longer when you grow old, I think you also deserve something. So, we will also give you a bonus, smaller, but we will call this a “V-Bonus”, “Voluntary Deferment Bonus”. I did not bring the details with me today. They are in Ng Eng Hen’s pocket and he will announce them when he goes to Parliament and explains the scheme.
The third question to ask is, what if you live longer than expected? This is the risk that the CPF will run out. This is what the insurance people call “longevity risk”. Normally, you think of dying as a risk, but here living is a risk; financially, it is. So, the question is what do you do? We have made the problem less because when you push the Draw-Down Age and the money lasts till 85 instead of 82, well, then it is three years later into your 80s, so that is good. But quite a number of people are still going to live beyond 85, some 90, some 100; not everybody, but quite a number will. So, what happens to them? You don’t want to be left destitute right at the end of your life.
Other pension schemes also face this same problem and one solution which they use is what they call annuities, which is a kind of insurance. You buy insurance, you take the lump sum, you give it to the insurance company, they invest it for you and then they pay you a monthly sum as long as you live, even to 100 or whatever. But, of course, if you die early then they stop paying you earlier and on average, it works out. In Switzerland, for example, they have a scheme like this — individual savings go up to 65. So, it is like similar to CPF, go up to 65. When you reach 65, you take out the individual savings and you have to buy an annuity, compulsory, and then you draw the annuity for the rest of your life.
Now, our CPF also allows annuities. We allow people to take their Minimum Sum, convert it into an annuity, instead of just drawing out every month until the money runs out. It’s a voluntary scheme, not a compulsory scheme, but very few people take it up. I think it is partly because Singaporeans don’t understand annuities, don’t understand why they need them. It is also because, frankly speaking, the returns have not been very attractive, the costs have been high. But despite these limitations, we do need annuities as part of our old-age planning. So, we will make some form of annuity compulsory for CPF members. It won’t apply immediately to this cohort about to retire but we’ll apply it to people who are now below 50-years-old. So that will give us some time. We can study the problem, consult industry, educate CPF members and work out the detailed scheme. We want to have some form flexibility into the scheme so that you can have an annuity which is tailored to your needs.
These are three major changes to the CPF — higher CPF interest, one per cent more on $60,000; later Draw-Down Age, pushed from 62 to 65 by 2018 and compulsory annuities for those who are now below 50-years-old. I’ve only outlined the big picture and the key points. I’ve omitted many of the details. Ng Eng Hen will make a full presentation. When Parliament meets, he will make a Ministerial Statement in September. These changes will bring our CPF system up to date, but they are not going to solve our problem for all time because our needs change, our demographic trends change. We have to continually update the system and make sure it’s adapted, not to today’s requirements or the requirements at that time we make the change, but to the requirements 15 or 20 years beyond that. And, in particular, 65 cannot be the stopping point. We are getting there first, as an intermediate target. When we get there we will look and set a new target and the new target needs to be at least 67 both for the re-employment age and for the Draw-Down Age. And if we make these changes in good time, then we can assure Singaporeans of peace of mind in your golden years.
Besides CPF savings, one other major policy we have is housing. Housing is both to narrow the income gap and also to build a nest egg for your old age because we help you to buy a house and give you something which is valuable, which is rooted in Singapore. When Singapore grows, property values go up, your flat’s value goes up and when the Government has surpluses, we upgrade your flats, neighbourhoods, new towns, and maintain the value. So, if you look at the three-room flats today, if you had bought a three-room flat in the early 1970s, it would have cost you maybe $8,000. Today, the three-room flat is worth $160,000, some places more. It’s been a fabulous investment, you have had a house to live in, you have got a nest egg which will see you through your retirement, provided you don’t cash out and go on holiday. But if you take care of it well, you have, through this HDB homeownership, you have participated in the growth of Singapore, bought shares in Singapore and backed this Singapore Inc and made it succeed.There are three parts to this housing issue which you should think about — the front end, helping people to buy the flat; the middle, maintaining and enhancing the value of the flat all the years you are living in it and then, at the tail end, monetizing the flat for your old age and we have policies for each of these pieces. At the front end, buying the flat is already a great privilege. Non-citizens cannot buy. If you are a citizen, you buy, but if you are a low-income citizen, we give you more help to buy the HDB flats and that’s why we introduced the additional housing grants last year. If you are less well-off, your subsidy is bigger, if you are more well-off, your subsidy is less. And when we give you more subsidy, we give it to you through your CPF so that if you sell your flat, it goes back to your CPF and it’s preserved either for your next flat or for old age, which I think is a good way to do it.
The additional housing grant has been a good scheme. I think we will enhance it further. Right now, the grant, maximum amount is $20,000. We will increase the maximum amount to $30,000. Now, a three-room flat, new from HDB today costs you about $120,000. So, $30,000 on that is a lot of money. We will also raise the household income ceiling for getting this housing grant. Now, the ceiling is $3,000 for household income. We’ll push it to $4,000 for household income and that way, we’ll cover about half of all the households in Singapore. So, I think through the additional housing grant, we can give more help to low-income Singaporeans buying flats.
At the tail-end, we will make it easier for people to monetize their flats to convert it into a stream of income. If you have a big flat, you can rent it out or rent out one room or you can downgrade. You have more choices. But I think the two- and three-room flats, if you live in a two- or three-room flats, which you have bought and especially if you’ve had only one bite of the cherry, I think you are deserving of some extra help. So, for this group, the Government will help them to unlock the value of their flats. Right now, they can sell it and move into a studio apartment, 30-year lease. But we will introduce a new alternative, a new scheme. Instead of letting you move out of the flat and going into a new place for 30 years, we will just let you stay in your flat and take back the tail of your lease and leave you with 30-years lease on your present flat. We will pay you for the tail of the lease and you get some money out, a lump sum upfront and then the rest pay into CPF, some form of annuity, monthly payments for the rest of your life. I think people who have bought small flats, people who have had one bite of the cherry, you all know what that means. This is for people who are 62 and above — you should not be doing this if you are 50-years-old — but 62 and above, I think we should allow you to do this. Thirty-year lease is quite long, but we are also studying what happens if it turns out that 30 years is not long enough and have some arrangement if you live longer. MND is studying this.
Today, I want to focus on this middle part of the HDB housing issue, which is enhancing the value of your home through upgrading and estate renewal and enhancing your home, enhancing your neighbourhood. We have many upgrading programmes, so many initials, but the most popular one is the LUP, Lift Upgrading Programme. We’ve made this a priority because of our aging population and we will complete the LUP for all the flats which can take the lifts by 2014, which is only seven years from now.
We also have schemes for private estates. I know the MPs with private estates remind me from time to time that we sometimes forget them, but we do have schemes. We have the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) for major upgrading works and many estates have enjoyed the EUP. But even then private estates sometime feel they are stepchildren, neglected. So, I’ve asked Lim Hwee Hua, who has a close interest in this because ofSerangoon Gardens, to chair a committee to see what we could do for private estates and she has come up with some recommendations which the Government has accepted. First of all, we will revamp the Estate Upgrading Programme. So, we will bring together all the pieces, coordinate all the works and make one big bang, whether it’s drains, whether it’s lights, whether it’s the streets, whether it’s car-parks, whether it’s parks, we will bring it together and make one good EUP with impact.
Secondly, there is something called CIPC, Community Improvement Project Committee funding, CIPC funds, which we use, advisers can use for doing, not very big projects in their own areas, but responsive to the residents’ needs. It can be a playground, it can be a little covered walkway, it can be a barbeque pit or something like that – small-scale but timely. Up to now, the CIPC has only been an HDB scheme. So, we will now extend the CIPC, same terms, to private estates. Lim Hwee Hua will tell you some more about the details later on.
Most Singaporeans live in public housing and this is HDB’s mission. So, we are continually finding ways to improve our public housing and to meet new needs and expectations. So, from Toa Payoh to Ang Mo Kio to Bishan to Pasir Ris to Sengkang, each new estate has been an improvement to previous one. The next new estate is Punggol. We started Ponggol 21 in 1998. Every time, I visit Punggol, they remind me. We had to slow down because of the financial crisis. But now, the demand is picking up again. I think it is time to get things back on track, but not just back on the old tracks. We have had time to study and to improve and upgrade the plan. So, this is Punggol 21 Plus.
I will start by showing you a satellite image. This is like Google Earth from outer space. Where is Punggol? We can zoom in and this is what it looks like today. So, you can see quite a lot of empty space, not yet developed. These are the parts which have already been built. So, we will now build on that, starting by damming up the mouths of the two rivers. This is Sungei Punggol, this is Sungei Serangoon and we will dam up the mouths of the rivers so that we have a fresh water lake, like the Marina. Then we will build a waterway to join up the two rivers so that you have a water feature, big one. Then we will build, on both sides of the waterway, starting with the town centre, which is around here, on the west side, but continuing all along the water.
Now, we will fly in for a closer look. So, you can see the waterway, the roads, the houses. The best views and the best houses are the ones facing the waterway and we will show you one view from inside one of these flats. I am not selling them yet! If you look outside, it will be blue and green in lots of places because we will have trees, plants, shrubbery by the water, on top of car parks, on top of buildings, make it cool, make it eco-friendly, green, good place to live. Among the early areas to be developed will be the town centre which would be on the waterfront and they will have malls, retail outlets, food, alfresco dining by the water.
Punggol 21 is going to take some years to build because there is, I think, altogether about 18,000 flats, public, some private, but akan dating. You can already see something coming up upstream of Punggol 21 in Anchorvale, Sengkang, Ang Mo Kio GRC. I will show you what it is. This is Anchorvale Community Centre. Actually, it should be called Anchorvale Country Club. The CC is here, this part is a sports complex. Four swimming pools, one, two, three, four. Football field, I suppose this is a grandstand and waterway so you can have water sports. And this side, this land is not the other side of Punggol River, this land is a floating island, courtesy of MEWR and PUB’s Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) Waters Programme. This is about to happen. It doesn’t quite look like that yet, but the buildings are already up. I was there last week and had a look at it and Lam Pin Min assures me that by the end of the year, it will be working.
So, that is a preview of what Punggol 21 Plus will look like. But let me show you, go back to outer space again and show you Punggol 21 after it isbuilt with the dams, with the houses and this is a very high resolution picture. The coastline is going to be a lot to do with the life of Punggol 21. If you zoom in this picture, something is happening on the coastline – canoeing. So, be careful somebody is watching you from up there. We may have a promenade where people can go for a walk, bring their old folks, jog, babies…or chilly crabs at the old Punggol Point, which all of you will remember and have great nostalgia. This is something which we will bring back, alfresco dining and lifestyle. It is going to be part of the new Punggol 21 Plus — the face of the new Singapore, a city with fun and buzz, not just in Punggol, but you can take the train, and go downtown to the IRs. But even with the fun and buzz, we must retain our present image – clean, green, and safe island. This is Singapore and it is quite important that we keep that brand recognition even as we acquire new attributes and new lifestyles. So, this the new estate.
Now, let me talk about the old estate in case you think that there is no place for old estates in Singapore. The old estates also have great potential. We are redeveloping selected sites within these estates, one by one, but where we can clear a big piece of land, then we can transform the whole area and make it like a new estate. I give you one example which will happen not too long in the future and that is Dawson Estate in Queenstown. I go back to the satellite map to show you where it is. It is in Queenstown. Just to get the orientation, it is next to the Queenstown MRT Station. This is Commonwealth Avenue, this is Alexandra Road, this is Margaret Drive. It already has had some SERs programmes which we were doing quietly. One of them has been built here. This is Forfar Heights, new SERS blocks and there are some other new developments in the area like this one here which is Clarence Ville. But as you can see, there is lots of empty space as well as a long Alexandra Canal which goes through it. So, it is not like Punggol waterway, but there is a linear feature there. We are going to start with three precincts, HDB precincts, one, two, three, and the canal, which we have covered over and are making it a linear park. So, there is enough space here for about 10,000 flats, mix of HDB and some private housing.
I will show you how the park is to look like. This is where it is and the precincts will be integrated with the park like that. These are sketches which have been put up by prize-wining architect firms, including some young, very talented architects. This is at one end of the park and I have another picture at the other end. This is public housing, not condominium. It is quite a change from what Dawson, Margaret Drive used to look like before, SIT flats, 1956. Some of you will remember it and you will also remember some of the landmarks there fondly, like the plaza near the town centre and the old wet market along Commonwealth Drive. We will keep these because it gives you a sense of history and place and we will integrate these into the new design. So, you can see the wet market doesn’t look like a wet market anymore, but it will retain the memories and the character of the place. It will be like the new towns but there is something extra which will bring people back.
The third piece is the middle-aged estate. People always talk about the “sandwiched class”. This is a “sandwiched flat”, not new, not old but middle-aged. We’ve had two key programmes to upgrade these, the Main Upgrading Programme and the Interim Upgrading Programme. We’ve been doing this since 1990, 17 years now. Many residents have benefited from them. I think it’s time to upgrade the upgrading programme. So, to do that, we have had Grace Fu chairing the Forum for HDB Heartware over the last year and she has received many requests and feedback. Now we have improved versions of the upgrading programmes which I will present to you.
First, the Interim Upgrading Programme (IUP), which spruces up the neighbourhood in each precinct. We will replace that with a Neighbourhood Renewal Programme. It is not just a change of name because the difference is the IUP used to be for individual precincts, but the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, we’ll get two or three precincts together, bigger area, larger scale. We can plan more and better facilities. We will still have standard items like the barbeque pits, community gardens, reflexology footpaths, covered walkways and so on, but now, we can also consider non-standard items like a street soccer court, which is very popular, or a skating park, which is also quite popular. We already have them in Bedok and Orchard. So, it can be something like this and when the children get going, I think it will be a lot of fun; quite a thrill for young people and maybe for their grandparents watching. But it is up to the residents to decide what you want. We will not decide it. We will have a budget and menu. You have a town hall meeting, residents get involved, you decide what you want for your own communities. That is the new IUP, it’s the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme.
For the individual flats, we will replace the Main Upgrading Programme, which is what we now have, with a new project called the Home Improvement Programme, HIP. It is more hip. It took feedback from focused groups and the most popular requests were the practical ones. They want practical improvements within the flat — spalling concrete, please fix that; toilets leaking, bathroom floor leaking, soil stack leaking, please fix that; entrance doors and grill gates, please replace that. So, here, I have shown you, you can see the spalling concrete here and the soil stack. These are the things which residents often bring to MPs when they come for MPS to show that their flats need some work done to them. So, with the HIP, we will fix this. So, good ceilings, good toilets, good doors. These are the practical things which people want for the Home Improvement Programme.
All of these upgrading programmes will cover many, many flats and they will be in housing estates all over Singapore. So, what I’d like to do now is to show you how all these pieces fit together. This is a map of Singapore showing all the HDB housing estates. So, you can see Tampines, Pasir Ris, Yishun, Woodlands, Jurong, Queenstown. I will first show you where the Main Upgrading Programme projects have been. Each dot is one precinct. So, we’ve got precincts all over Singapore and it’s about 100,000 flats which have benefited from the Main Upgrading Programme. These are flats which were built in 1980 and before. About half of them already have the MUP or are in progress. The other half has not had the MUP yet. We will now bring them on to the Home Improvement Programme. So, these are the light blue dots, another 100,000 flats.
If you look carefully, you can probably see where your own precinct is. But I think that we should bring the Home Improvement Programme to a younger batch of flats because 1980 is a long time ago. The flats have grown older since then. In the early 1980s, up to, say, 1986, these were years when HDB built many, many flats every year, peak construction. Some years, we built 50,000 flats and unfortunately, I would say the QC was sometimes not quite up to today’s standards. So, a lot of complaints. It’s been 25 years, the wear and tear is starting to show. We’ve fixed it over the years, but I think what we should do is to extend the Home Improvement Programme to another batch of flats, those built 1986 and before and I will show you where they are — 200,000 more houses will get the HIP, red spots all over Singapore, like measles but good ones.
Now, you will see that many of these red spots are in about four or five housing estates like Tampines, Hougang, Yishun, Bukit Batok and Jurong East because these were the estates which were built in the early 1980s. They are the ones which are of this age group. So, we will pilot this Home Improvement Programme with two of these estates, which will be Tampines and Yishun as pilot projects and I fully expect the pilot project to work and then we can extend it to the other flats as well. There are 200,000 flats here.
But there are flats which are slightly younger than this up to, say, 1989. I think they also should get something. So, for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, we will extend the age limit and push it to 1989. I will show this to you in green dots.
So, the conclusion is you have spots all over Singapore and nearly every housing estate is covered. There are a few housing estates, which are not covered, which are in darker brown — Sembawang, Chua Chu Kang, Sengkang, Punggol, Pasir Ris. It’s because they are too young, built in the 1990s and after, but their turn will come. No need for upgrading yet but provided Singapore continues to grow and we have the resources and the surpluses, we will have future upgrading programmes and we will progressively extend these to them as well.
How will our estates look like after all the upgrading? I asked HDB. They said, “I’ll get our computers to show you”. So, we have a video clip of what the new-look housing estate will be like. This will be a first-class living environment, greenery, water, homes coming up, integrated with it. You see the homes coming up in the background, parks, people, life, community. So, we can draw our communities closer together, foster a sense of belonging.
No other city in the world can do this, public housing that is attractive, that is affordable, that is appealing, that gives a quality home for every citizen and gives you an asset which will appreciate in value and will also provide for your old age. But in Singapore, we can do it, provided we make the effort and work hard together. Systematically, we will upgrade and renew our homes. We will remake the whole city. It will take us 20, 30 years, but eventually, the whole country will be transformed and this is what Singaporeans will call home.
It’s a lot to promise, it’s something which we can deliver. I think that we ought to give an acknowledgement to the people who put in the work to make this happen. First of all, the HDB, but to make the video, HDB can’t do it alone. We had a very powerful team, Nanyang Polytechnic School of Interactive and Digital Media. I think my two experts are here. Can they take a bow?
Tonight, I’ve focused on the widening income gap and especially on ageing. I have explained our major strategies to tackle this — upgrading education, working longer, improving CPF; upgrading and renewing our housing estates and our whole city. I have brought them together tonight so that Singaporeans can understand the whole picture. These are difficult challenges but we will work out solutions for each one of them, one by one.
Singapore’s strength lies in our people, dedicated workers and capable leaders; not just individual stars or few top bodies, but a cohesive society and a strong Singapore team. Each person giving his best for the nation, doing things together that none of us could have achieved on our own. This is our greatest asset and this is the secret of our success.
We are all set to surge ahead. After SARS, we estimated Singapore’s sustainable growth at three to five per cent. We were a little bit conservative, but we thought it was realistic. In the light of the last few years, MTI has reviewed these numbers and we’ve concluded that we should go for a higher target. So, we are raising our growth estimate to four to six per cent for the next five to ten years. At our stage of our development forSingapore, this is a very ambitious target. Very few countries have done it, maybe Japan until it ran into problems in the 1990s, but not the European countries not even America. But I think we can do it provided we continue to adapt, stay open, remain competitive and ride the wave. Then we will grow with the whole of Asia and not just based on what we have on this little island in Singapore, physically here. For the next few years, conditions are very favourable. We should strive to do better than four to six per cent.
The wind is filling our sails, let’s catch the wind, set the course ahead and go for it. Last year, our sailors at the Asian Games in Doha came home with five gold medals. I watched the final keelboat match against India. I am sure many of you would have done so even though it was about two o’clock in the morning, Singapore time. Both teams used identical boats, but Singapore won. What made the difference? Our team, the five-man crew — Justin Wong, Renfred and Roy Tay, Ivan Tan and the skipper, Teo Wee Chin — their abilities and their skills, their training, their team work, their determination and their will, never give up, think coolly under pressure, battle tenaciously and prevail and they are here tonight.
This is the Singapore spirit which will see us through as we remake our nation and build our home together. Whatever the challenges, we will tackle them one by one and sail through. Over the next decade, we have a unique opportunity to transform Singapore. Together, let’s make this truly a City of Possibilities and a home for all of us. Goodnight.
Singapore’s strength lies in our people, dedicated workers and capable leaders; not just individual stars or few top bodies, but a cohesive society and a strong Singapore team.PM Lee Hsien Loong

   singaporewebsite update april",14493,"Singapore is actively pursuing developments to strengthen its economy and social cohesion amidst global challenges. The nation is capitalizing on its position as ASEAN Chairman to foster regional integration and cooperation, particularly with neighboring countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Domestically, Singapore is focusing on securing its economic future by restructuring its economy, reforming taxes, and enhancing its global competitiveness through initiatives like the development of Integrated Resorts and the remodeling of the city.

A significant challenge addressed is the widening income gap, exacerbated by globalization and technological advancements. The government is tackling this through educational enhancements, ensuring that every citizen receives a quality education that equips them with necessary skills for a competitive job market. Additionally, policies are being adapted to support an aging population, including discussions on housing and healthcare.

Singapore's approach to maintaining social cohesion involves upgrading public housing and urban areas to improve living conditions and ensure every citizen has a stake in the country's success. The government is also adjusting the Central Provident Fund (CPF) system to better cater to the needs of its citizens in their retirement years.

Overall, Singapore is taking a proactive and comprehensive approach to address both economic and social challenges, aiming to ensure stability and prosperity for its citizens in a rapidly changing world."
2008,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, good evening again.
Tonight I will start by talking about the economy. I have not done so in detail over the last few years because the economy was doing well. So we were focusing on social issues, the income gap, ageing population, and CPF. But it is timely to pay some attention to the economy now because conditions this year are more difficult. Over the last few years when conditions were good, we surged ahead. We did the right thing, we planned, we pushed, we built up our momentum, restructured and upgraded our economy and brought in a pipeline of good projects – F1 Grand Prix, the IRs, our financial services, banking doing well, major investments brought in by EDB through very hard work. Now these projects will sustain our momentum and keep our economy going. But dark clouds have gathered around us in the external environment. The US faces very serious problems. Their house prices had a balloon, bubble, crash and are still falling.
Unemployment is going up, consumers are losing confidence, spending less and it is affecting the rest of the world as has to be expected. In Europe, the major economies have gone into negative growth and we must expect impact on Asia also. These global economic problems will continue at least into next year and some experts think it may last even longer. We are starting to feel the impact in Singapore.
In the second quarter, our growth has slowed down, our manufacturing sector has been affected, our exports are weak this year, tourist arrivals are down. Even Asian tourists are travelling less partly because airline fares have gone up with fuel costs. Retail stores say that customers are more careful and restaurants have also fewer guests now in Singapore. Singaporeans are more careful with their money. This year I think we can get four to five per cent growth. It is not bad. Next year we expect slow growth and more uncertainties. I am not predicting a crisis. We are competitive, investors still want to come to Singapore and we have a strong pipeline as I explained. But we have to be vigilant and we have to be psychologically ready in case of trouble. We also must be on our marks so when the global economy recovers, we can bounce right back up.
Right now, the hottest issue for Singaporeans is the rising cost of living. Inflation is not just a problem for Singapore, it is a worldwide problem because oil prices have gone up, food prices have gone up. I show you a graph of oil prices over the last few years and you can see how in 2000, we were paying about US$20 a barrel. Gradually it went up US$60 and in the last one year it spiked all the way up, nearly US$140, now back to about US$115 a barrel.
Food is an even more dramatic story. I show you rice because that is what affects Singaporeans and you can see the price has been very stable for a very long time, gone up a bit two years ago, and in the last one year tremendous spike, now come down some to US$800 per ton. Maybe it will stabilise there or maybe it will come down a little bit and similarly with oil there are some signs that maybe it will come down a little bit.  But even if it does, it is still high and it is quite understandable why people are agitated all over the world and demonstrating, rioting, protesting, blaming their governments. I show you some slides from around the world. This is Europe, these are truckers in France protesting about diesel prices, so they are blocking the roads. This is Spain, farmers put all their tomatoes on the road because their fuel prices have gone up. Indonesia, the government raised prices for kerosene, demonstrations and riots. Pakistan, they are not having a dance, they are showing their displeasure at the government because food prices went up. Philippines, they sell their people subsidised rice, ran short of supply, there was a scramble, mad scramble, the government had to scramble internationally to buy rice, domestically long queues, big problem.
Fortunately in Singapore we have plenty of rice. So you do not see riots. All you see is Iswaran, SMS (MTI), inspecting our rice stockpile but I know that people are unhappy still about the price increases. I have read a lot of the interesting things on the Internet. Some are quite good. I do not have time to show you all of them but I will just show you one tonight. This one says “Wah Piang Eh!The ERP has reached Pedra Branca”. I sent this to Raymond Lim. He said that is his favourite one too.
I completely understand how Singaporeans feel and why Singaporeans feel like this. But we have to react rationally to understand what is happening to us and what we can and cannot do about it. We cannot prevent prices from rising in Singapore. We import all our food except for a few eggs and Mah Bow Tan reminded me a few fish. We import all our fuel and all our electricity is produced from imported either fuel oil or natural gas. When the world prices go up, how can we keep our rice prices, our petrol prices, our diesel prices, our electricity prices down? It cannot be done. In terms of dollars, your wages have not gone down because most workers are earning more dollars this year than last year. Last year was a good year, people got good increases, got good bonuses, so you have more dollars. But when you spend those dollars, you find that they have shrunk and with inflation, what that means is some of your wage increase went to you, some of that wage increase went to the people who sell us oil. So, to put this in a very over-simplified way, the oil producers of the world have got rich. The Russians, the Arabs, they have got rich. The oil consumers of the world like Singapore, therefore, we have got a little bit poorer. That is what it is. They are richer, we are poorer. How has it happened? Not by taking dollars away from you but by shrinking each of your dollars a little bit smaller when you spend it.
We have got to keep our economy competitive... then we can raise our standard of living despite increases in oil and food prices.PM Lee Hsien Loong

PM Lee Hsien Loong
Singaporeans wish that the government would do something to stop these prices from going up, just order them to stand still, control them, do not let them go up. Some governments try to do that but the subsidies cost huge sums of money. All the governments which try to do this have a very serious problem on their hands. And even those who produce oil and gas find this very hard to sustain. You look at Malaysia, they subsidise oil but what happens? Singaporeans go to Johor Baru to top up. Thais go across from Thailand into Kedah to top up, not your petrol tank but a huge special tank in a truck so as to get maximum benefit and they are oil producers. They have had to cut their oil subsidies and push up prices recently. Malaysia, Indonesia did that, also an oil producer. China produces some oil, India also, no oil, but they were subsidising. It is untenable. We cannot do that but we can help Singaporeans and the way we help Singaporeans is to let the electricity price go up but to top up your SingPower accounts with U-save and give more U-Save to the poorer households, three room flats, two room flats and what that means is we are helping you directly because U-save really is cash. We are putting it into your account, up to you to spend. If you use it for electricity, it helps you to cover your bill. If you use less electricity it will last longer. But it is a lot of money because for the lower-income households, three rooms and below, it is worth three to six months’ worth of your utility bills. So that is a lot of money. We can help but we have to help in the right way. This year, we have done more to help Singaporeans.
We foresaw this spike in inflation last year, towards the end of the year as prices started rising. We knew that Singaporeans would be worried. We started planning what we could do to help them, what we could do to reassure people and when it came to the Budget, fortunately we had a surplus last year. We were able to make a significant distribution in the Budget to help all Singaporeans but especially for the middle-income groups and even more for the lower-income groups, the needy. So we have growth dividends, Medisave top ups, U-save, so many measures, such long lists but all to give help where the help is needed.
Besides the Budget, we have many other measures to help the needy. For the lower-income workers, we have got Workfare to top up their income and savings. This year in the National Wages Council deliberations, we made a special one-off payment to the low wage workers. We recommended it and many employers have done it because we knew that they would be pressed this year. For the destitute, we have higher public assistance rates which we have revised up this year, I think it is now $330 per person. We have got Comcare, we have got Medifund and for retirees, we have pushed up the CPF interest rate which was one of the things we discussed here last year at the rally. One extra per cent interest on the first $60,000 of your balances and it has come into effect this year and it will help to preserve the value of your CPF savings for your old age. So it is helpful to retirees, it is helpful to the young people and not so young but not yet old. Overall, it is $3 billion from the government this year and I think that is not a small sum of money.
I know that many Singaporeans who are not so poor but also not so well off feel that they are pressured. Middle-income Singaporeans and they feel that they are the sandwiched class, stuck in the middle. But when you ask who is the sandwiched class, all the way from quite low down to quite high up, it is a very fat sandwich but they feel sandwiched and we have not forgotten them. We have got growth dividends extended to them. We have helped them with their education costs, for example, the polytechnic and university bursaries have been extended, so a large proportion of students are now eligible for bursaries. We have topped up the post secondary education accounts for all school-age children and that includes all of the middle-income groups and that is a big sum of money.
I know that the middle-income put a lot of emphasis on education and this is one way to build up, so when your kids go to poly or university, that little kitty, that nest egg is there. But overall, I think our most important strategy to help the middle-income group is to keep our taxes low and therefore minimise your burden. If you look at our personal income taxes, actually they are already lower than most other countries and for middle-income Singaporeans, in fact, our income tax is lower even than Hong Kong by quite a lot. On top of that, this year we gave a generous 20 per cent personal income tax rebate in the budget costing us nearly $400 million aimed at this middle-income Singaporeans. I think if you look at it in perspective, we have done a great deal to try and help the middle-income Singaporeans.
I know there is one item which middle-income Singaporeans worry a lot about and that is cars. Car-related taxes are something which the government studies very carefully. I would acknowledge that at one time the car-related taxes were a significant burden on car owners, and many of them are middle-income. Because our car ownership taxes had become so high, we needed to control the number of cars, we pushed up the ARF, excise duty, so many items and the amount per car was very high and was disproportionate. Hence, we discussed this when we had the Economic Review Committee a few years ago which I chaired and we decided to make a major policy shift to shift from ownership to usage so that we could bring down the ownership taxes, ARF, excise duty and so on. We could issue more COEs so that they’ll be more affordable, then we could enable more people to afford cars. But to do all these good things, we would have to push up ERP so that we can control traffic jams on the roads.
In fact, we have moved decisively on that. I put together some figures to show you. It is easiest if I show you on a graph. But if you compare 2000 before we moved and 2008, where we are today, you will know how far we have come. In 2000, the government collected S$6 billion in vehicle-related revenues. S$6 billion, it is a huge amount of money, it is like two or three times the amount of GST we collected in that year. Because we have changed policy by 2008, the amount has come down. Halved – S$3 billion. So we have effectively saved Singaporeans about S$3 billion of tax and this includes everything. But to do this, we have had to push up the ERP. By how much? In 2000, that is all the ERP there was – S$80 million. This tiny sliver at the top of the whole stick. This year, after a lot of ERP adjustments, we have doubled it. It’s S$160 million but still very small compared to the total amount of road taxes which are collected. Despite this, we have still made this big reduction in the road taxes which we have collected, which is savings to Singaporeans. And because of these savings, therefore, more households have been able to own cars. In 2000, there were about 320,000 households owning cars. Since then, in the last eight years, the number has gone up. Now 430,000 households have owned cars, which is about one-third more, 100,000 households. I think this is something which is worth trying to do because many Singaporean households want to own cars and we have been able to enable more of them to do so. How have we been able to do that? By bringing down vehicle taxes and how have we been able to do that? This little red sliver here by pushing up the ERP. This is in terms of overall growth numbers, billions. But if you are buying an individual car, one household, one car, you can see the difference. So I have chosen as an example of 1.6 litre car, typical Toyota Corolla, it was there in 2000, it is there this year. In 2000, how much do you think it cost to buy a Toyota Corolla all in? S$110,000. This year, for the same car, in fact the salesman will tell you it is a better car, the price has gone down to $64,000. This is mainly because the government taxes have come down because the OMV has remained about the same. It was about S$19,000 before, now it is $16,000. So basically the Government taxes have made the cars a lot more affordable. So the result of this is that there are more cars around us, you can see it HDB car parks getting more crowded, you can see it on the roads. Therefore, because of this, this year we have had to increase ERP charges.
I know many people are upset by these ERP charges. But we have to see the bigger picture because in fact, the ERP charges are enabling us to benefit Singaporeans so as to reduce the burden on you and to enable more Singaporeans to own cars. So when we had to make the adjustment this year, we considered it very carefully, how should we do this without increasing the burden on Singaporeans and we worked out an ERP package, not just raising the ERP or putting more gantries, but reducing road tax at the same time so as to offset it and overall, to bring down the costs. Let me show you how this works. Before the package, let us take the 1.6 liter car again, probably a Toyota but could be another one. Before the package, the ERP was $122. After the package, it has gone up nearly $200. So it looks very frightening but in fact, if you consider the road tax which you have to pay and which we have adjusted – you used to pay $874 of the road tax, and now it has come down to $744. So the net effect is that you have a saving. In fact, you’re saving money rather than out of pocket because of the ERP changes. How much? Let us do the sums. ERP increase $76; road tax reduction $130; net savings $54. So overall, there is a net saving from this package. So we have not increased the burden on Singaporeans. We have actually reduced the burden on Singaporeans by some. The trouble is people may not realise or remember how much road tax they are paying or even worse how much road tax they paid last year. Sometimes they may not be the ones paying it. I asked one driver how much road tax she paid because she was complaining about the gantries she went through and the beeps which she heard.  So she thought for a while and then she said to me, “I am not sure, I have to ask my husband”. Because she did not pay the bill, her husband paid the bill and I am not sure even when the husband paid the bill, he noticed that it was smaller this year. Furthermore when the husband pays the bill, there is no beep-beep but when the wife drives the car, each gantry, one beep. So that is the problem and I think that is part of the reason why people are not happy. So we have to draw the connections and get people to understand that actually the middle-income Singaporeans have benefited from government policies.
But we have not only thought about road tax and car drivers because the point of all this is to have a system which will work for all Singaporeans and that means improving our public transport. So together with pushing up the ERP, we are building more rail lines, we have more trains running, about 800 more trips every week. So the waiting times have come down, the overcrowding during peak hours has come down. Bus services are getting improved. We are making the transfers more convenient and cheaper because the transfer rebate will go up. So we are doing many things. We cannot in the end have every household in Singapore own a car like in America, that is not possible. But what we can do is to have the roads free flowing and a first class public transport system for everybody.
Besides cars and public transport, we also have to pay attention to the wider needs of the public and you can get a good sense of what the public is worried about by looking at the mix of the Meet-the-People Session (MPS) cases which the MPs hold. I do my own MPS from time to time, the MPs do regularly and I can tell you what we find. Not many job-seekers unlike during the last recession because there are a lot of jobs to go around. There are some hardship cases but we have a lot of schemes to help them – you have got vouchers, you have got ComCare, you have got CCC schemes, CDC programmes and so on. I talked about some just now. But there is one worrying trend in the MPS cases and that is, here are more and more people looking for HDB rental flats. And in one year, the number of applications has gone up, tripled and now they form the bulk of our MPS cases – the biggest group is people looking for rental flats. Many, many reasons. HDB is building more rental flats but if you look into the applications, not all of those who apply for rental flats are truly needy. And HDB gave me some examples. I show you one where a woman aged 60 was applying for rental flat and she had three children. Two of them live in private property and the children wrote down do not worry, we will jointly hire a maid to look after our mother. Please, can she have a rental flat. I think families must have their problems otherwise they would not go and look for MPs or HDB for help but I think that for this group of people, rental flats are not the right solution. Instead, they should look for other viable alternatives. They can rent out a room, they can even rent out the whole flat, move in with their children. We are going to have the Lease Buyback scheme for the two-room and three-room flats which is going to be implemented next year. Or they could sell their flat and move into a smaller flat or move into a studio apartment, also with a short lease and therefore, free up some money. So there are various ways they can solve their problems but I think we have to manage this rental flat problem. MND and HDB will be reviewing the scheme for rental flats so that we can keep an effective safety net for the people who need this, the minority of genuinely needy families who have not only no income but also no assets and also no family support.
So I have talked about the poor, I have talked about the middle-income, I have talked about those who need housing rentals. I think for the vast majority of Singaporeans, we have provided comprehensive measures in the budget. Most people do not realise how much they are getting and as I said in the Chinese speech just now, if you take a three-room flat, a low-income household, say an elderly couple with one child working. They are getting this year from the government, $5,000 all in, which is much more than any increase in their cost of living. And if you take a middle-income household, five-room, let us say middle age working parents two children, which is a typical profile, they get not a small sum either, about $3,400 and that is not counting any personal income tax rebates which they may be getting. So I think we have done a fair amount to help Singaporeans but inflation has turned out higher than expected, especially electricity and fuel prices and the economy is a bit more uncertain than the outlook at the beginning of the year. So I think after looking at the budget position, we can do a little bit more.
There is a second instalment of the Growth Dividends coming on 1st October. We will increase this by 50 per cent. And because energy electricity is such a heavy bill now, and some people’s bills have gone up by 100 per cent even more. So this year’s U-save rebates, we will also push it up by 50 per cent. Which means for a three-room household like the one I mentioned earlier, they get about $500 more all in and a five-room household will get about $200 more. Overall this is going to cost us $250 million to the Government, a quarter billion dollars. If you add it to all the other things we are doing, I think it will help Singaporeans see us through this period. But I would say please don’t think thathong baosare going to solve this problem. We cannot give hong baos all the time and giving ourselves hong baos does not help address the problem of the oil producers becoming richer and Singaporeans becoming poorer. To address that problem, we have got to keep our economy competitive, we have got to produce more, be more productive, therefore, earn more for ourselves. Then we can raise our standard of living despite increases in oil and food prices.
The well-being of Singaporeans depends not just on bread and butter issues but also on our human and social environment which means on how we behave, how we relate to one another as Singaporeans. How can we make Singapore a more gracious society? We have done many things over the years to improve ourselves. We have got all sorts of campaigns and initiatives. Queue up, be courteous, no spitting, please flush toilets. Most recently service excellence, go the extra mile for Singapore. Sometimes people laugh at us but actually these are things which we can work on and improve and if we make people aware of their behaviour and conscious of the impact on others, we can educate them and gradually they can learn new habits and they will respond and our social norms will upgrade, and we have made progress. For us living in Singapore, seeing one another day by day, you do not notice. For people who come here once in a while and see us at long intervals, it is like one of these speeded-up movies. They can see the difference.

There was a letter in the Straits Times forum page recently which was very interesting and I was very moved reading it. It was from a Sri Lankan lady who had visited Singapore 40 years ago when she came here on her way to America to be a postgraduate student and she came back again recently. Now much older and she needed a wheelchair at the airport and she spent a few days in Singapore and she was sufficiently moved to write this letter which the Straits Times published. Let me read a little bit of it. ""From the moment I landed until I left, the city impressed me. Everywhere I met only kindness. I was in a shopping centre and asked a young girl the way to the MRT station. She offered to show me the way and taking my shopping bags, led me to the station. Shopkeepers gave me water to drink. People waiting for a bus walked with me to the correct bus stop, and people helped me cross the street. I have never experienced this sort of kindness anywhere else in the world.""
I think she must have been a very nice lady but the people who behaved so well to her, flew the flag for Singapore. We do not know who they are but we should thank them. We can do even better, of course. We have a Singapore Kindness Movement and it conducts surveys of social behaviours that Singaporeans consider important and not important and they showed me a list of the different things. Quite interesting – ""not important"", or considered not important, does not mean really not important, but considered ""important"" at least shows me where some of the problems are. So some of the things we are good at are sitting properly at the cinema. Do not put your feet on the chair in front of you. Very difficult for tall people like me. Say thank you after being served – that people remember. But other things we are not so good. Say please – are not so common. Clear tables and return food trays – we need to improve. We are trying to inculcate this habit. I do not understand. Every national service man knows exactly what to do in his cookhouse. Maybe we need more reservists training. But at Suntec City, no reservists, no NSmen, it is going to take time to change the mindset, because the mindset is I go to the food courts to eat and not to clean tables. So I got a letter recently from somebody, a lady, an email, talking exactly about this, about how we should make Singapore a more happy place to live. And she mentioned this. She said “Actually we should feel quite embarrassed to leave our dirty plates and dirty tables for the next diner. In my Mum’s house, after eating we will clear our plates and clean the table. This is a good habit we should adopt outside the home”. Then she went on to add, “Oh yes, most importantly, no fines, no fines. Dishing out fines hurt relationships and no good image for PAP Government.” So I thank her for her good wishes. We shall try and find some ways before thinking about fines.
One of the ways we have thought about, which MediaCorp thought about, was to hold a contest on Morning Express, Class 95FM. And we have the deejays, famous people, Glenn Ong and the Flying Dutchman, who are here tonight. They invited listeners to send in their videos of the best and the worst Singaporean habits. Tremendous response. So I asked Mediacorp to compile some highlights. Good and ugly, to share with you.

So there you are. I think the filmmaking is outstanding, the conduct can be improved. I think the best way to focus our efforts is when there’s a major event and we are put to the test. And we have done well before. The International Olympic Council meeting in 2005, the IMF and World Bank meetings in 2006, and we put on a really good show, not just to impress people, but because that is the way we want to be. And now we have to prepare for other major events. F1 next month, APEC next year, Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2010. Let us use these opportunities to improve our social graces. This is how other countries have done it. The Olympic Games, Sydney 2000. It set a very high benchmark. The show was very good, but what really impressed visitors was the genuine warmth and the sincerity of the Australians. There were 47,000 volunteers. They cheered, they drove buses, they manned checkpoints, they greeted visitors, they were friendly, effective, polite. They said “G'day mate” and after a while you know what that means and you feel welcomed, created a whole atmosphere of friendliness and hospitality.
China is now hosting the Olympic Games. They have made a huge effort to welcome the athletes and the visitors. And you watched the opening ceremony, that is spectacular, but you may not have noticed that they had launched large scale civility campaigns to educate people and they designated special days of the month for special movements. So the 11th of the month is queuing up day - 排队日, because 11, one-one. The 22nd of every month is “Give your seat to others day” (让位日) because 22 look like two chairs side by side. For the Games, they mobilised 100,000 volunteers, mostly young men and women, university students, and others. Tremendous pride in their country. Every willingness to go the extra mile, to impress the visitors. That here is a people who are proud of their country and who want to make visitors feel welcomed.
So we too should mobilise ourselves for the YOG. It is the first time ever the Games are being held. So let us make a special effort to make sure that it is an outstanding YOG. We mobilised very successfully to support the bid when Teo Ser Luck went around. He is not here, he is in Beijing tonight. And Singaporeans from all walks of life spontaneously organised themselves to participate, schools, youth groups, companies, taxi drivers and I think this grassroots participation impressed the IOC and so we won the bid. So let us rally together again. Show what Singapore is about and welcome the world with our spirit and our warmth. But we must not just stop at the YOG. We have got to work consistently at this, patiently over many years, strive for higher standards and a permanent improvement in our behaviour, not for other people, but for ourselves. So that we can be proud of ourselves and make Singapore a better place for all of us.
I have just got an update on the game (Beijing Olympics, Women's Team Table Tennis). Singapore 0, China 2. Game is still progressing.
We are creating a better Singapore for future generations to enjoy. So my next topic is babies. This is a very long story. So I have prepared a special slide which captures the story. Let me show you. This is a slide which shows our total fertility rate (TFR), which means the average number of children born per woman over her lifetime. This shows the TFR from 1960 all the way to right now, 2007 last year, coming down like this and this single slide tells us about our history, about our economy, about our culture and about our policies.
Let me show you. The history is this graph. From six children per woman in 1960 coming down to the mid-70s to 2.1, which is the replacement level, because you need about two children per woman to replace herself and her husband. And then continuing to go down till it is about 1.3 today. It is the same story which we see in Korea, in Taiwan, in China, all over Asia. As the economy developed, as we educated our people, as women got jobs and they were liberated, they stopped just having one baby after another at home and the numbers came down. That is our history.
But if you zoom in to the last 30 years, you will see more interesting details, starting with the way our economy is, because actually people have control over when they want their kids. So when the economy goes down and times are uncertain and people worry about where they are going to get their next meal, they put off having children. So we look at the graph coming down, but the times when it comes down sharply, like here in the mid-1980s, it is usually because the economy is not doing well. There was a recession in 1985 where there was quite a problem. In the late 90s, it has gone down again and that was the Asian crisis. Then if you look down here, comes down again, 9/11 and SARS. So each time there is a crisis, people put off having babies. Crisis passes, numbers bounce back up, but never quite go back to where it used to be.
But you can see something else very interesting in this graph. Look at the peaks rather than the low points. Take this one. 1976. Why is that? You take this one, another peak, 1988. When you look at the next one, 2000. Dragon years. But each dragon smaller than the next dragon. So 2012, I worry for the little dragon.
You can also see our policies in this chart. Family policies. In the 1960s, the policy was two is enough. Fabulously successful. In fact, over successful. We had a poster, you remember this girl or boy, two is enough. Two little girls. We achieved the target, we over-fulfilled our plan. Went down, late 80s we had to change our message. Three if you can afford it. So this was after the dip here. We got alarmed, we changed, three kids. And it worked. There was some effect, quite successful, went up, the dragon helped, but it stayed up for quite long and then unfortunately it came down again, and then we decided we needed some more policies, so we had Baby Bonus in 2001 and Child Development Co-Saving Scheme. That is the proper name, but actually we call it Baby Bonus. And that unfortunately did not work because we were hit by 9/11 and SARS and come here, 2004, this was my little contribution, my first Rally. Marriage and Procreation Package. You see, we have given up having a lot of pictures, just one little infant. And if you study the graph very carefully, you can see that in fact there were some improvements, just a little bit, but you really can’t see it very well, we need a magnifying glass. So we zoom in with a magnifying glass. 2004, 1.26, 2007, 1.29. So, improvement, but the target is 2.1. So 1.5 is here, 2.1 is here. We are going to have a problem.
So the question is, what more should we do? I think, first, we should encourage people to get married. And second, we should encourage couples to have children. The first step is to get the right partner and get married. I am not an expert in this. So I consulted the experts, those with experience and I talked to some of the matchmakers.
We have SDU, we have SDS, we have quite a number of private dating agencies now which have come along. So I talked to several of them and we had a very lively lunch exchange. I learnt a lot from them and it’s fabulous material for a TV studio discussion, which one day they will do. They told me so many interesting stories which put it graphically in real people’s lives, the practical problems and how it works and what the difficulties are.
So let me just summarise the main learning points. First of all, and encouragingly, many singles want to get married. They are not happy to be single, they want to get married, they are serious, they are not just out to have a good time, but they face difficulties. What are these difficulties? Some have never dated. They did not date in school. They started work, once they settled into a routine, they are older, no chance, no social circle at all, no opportunities to meet new people. So one matchmaker told me one conversation he had. He talked to this lady. What do you do after work? First of all, what do you do? She says I work. After work what do you do? I go to the gym. Weekends? I stay at home with my parents. You go out? Yes, I bring out my nephews and nieces. So he says oh dear, everybody will think that these are her children and will not chat her up. So have you met any new friends last week? Dead silence. How about last month? Again, dead silence.
So they have a problem. How do you break out of this? Some people date, but they start too late and the dating agencies tell me that the women in their 30s have a big problem. They join up, they sign up and there are men in their 30s too who sign up. But the men in their 30s want to look for women in their 20s. Why? They make a very practical calculation. You see, I am 30 something, supposing I marry a woman who is 30 something, takes me a year to get to know her, we get married, we want to enjoy ourselves for a couple of years before we think about having babies, then we think about having babies, you add it up, I will be 40 something, my wife will be 40 something. How? So therefore the 30-something-year-old looks for the 20-something-year-old girl. And the 30-something year old girl has a big problem and I feel for her because I had a dialogue with some women. The women’s wing organised it for me and one such lady stood up. She had great courage and she stood up and she spoke and she explained her problem. That she started off putting her career first. She worked, she built up her career. After she got her career sorted out in her 30s, she started thinking about looking for a partner. She joined, signed up dating agencies, tried, no joy. And she was sharing her experience with us and with the room. She still hopes to find someone, but it will be quite hard.
So that is a real problem. The good news is that more people are prepared to seek help from the dating agencies and the women are more willing to look for help than the men. The men are macho, sensitive about their ego, they do not want to be seen going for help. The women are more prepared to go. So most dating agencies have more women than men, 60-40. That is an encouragement to the men to sign up. But unfortunately, sometimes their social graces are not up to scratch. So the dating agency told me another story. They arranged for a guy to meet a date and the setting was a romantic dinner in a nice restaurant. The guy turned up in slippers. So he counselled the guy. The guy says, that is me, I work in slippers, I walk in slippers, I come in slippers. So they talked to him, finally persuaded him to buy a pair of shoes, keep the shoes in his car. So before getting down at the date, he puts on his shoes, he meets, he goes for the date. And it worked.
So it went a little further. Next thing he knew, the man gave him a call. He says, what is happening. He says “I am outside my girlfriend’s house”. So he said, “Are you stalking her? Why are you there?” He says “No, no, no, she has invited me to meet her parents”. That is good. So he asked him, “Did you bring a present? He said, no. So he was directed, ran around, bought a present, came back, knocked on the door, went in, eventually it worked, got married and then the lady said to him, “Quite interesting, very unlike you to have brought a present”. So I thought to myself, “Wow, I was lucky, when I was invited to meet my girlfriend’s parents, I did not bring a present either”. Fortunately we got married.
But you also need to have realistic expectations. You have to make an effort for the relationship to work. You must not be carried away by what you see, romantic images on the movies. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl instantly, madly, married, lives happily ever after, maybe have twin babies. But we are real people, ordinary people in real life. You may not have instant sparks the first time, but you take your time, discover the person for who he or she is. Nurture the relationship and then maybe love may blossom. That is how many Indian couples do it. They are match-made, they do not know each other very well before they marry, but they develop the relationship and it works. So when I told this story to the women’s group, there were two Indian women sitting in the front row, nodding vigorously. I talked to them afterwards, they turned out to be immigrants. Both had lived here quite some time. Both had been match-made to their husbands, both happily married. And they said yes, this is the way, this is one good way to do it.
I think that we have to take a practical approach to this. We’ll do more to help singles get married to the extent that we can. We have the SDU, we have the SDS – Social Development Unit, Social Development Service in the PA. They’re working on this, they’re doing a very good job. Now they’re catering to different markets, graduates, non-graduates. SDU graduates, SDS non-graduates. I think we shouldn’t be so rigid. We should merge the two. Have one, more critical mass, more activities and hopefully more pairing ups, more weddings and more children.
A lot of people want the SDU, SDS because they are government. So they know this is real. They know this is serious. They know this is not some escort agency. It is respectable. But there are also young people who do not want the government to know that they are dating and would like to use private agencies but want quality assurance because just in case, the private agency is not respectable, they do not want to be trapped. So we are going to try to give them the best of both worlds. SDU will go into a new business to certify private agencies that meet quality standards. We have CaseTrust. We will have SDU Trust (Mark). Put a logo down there (referring to slide).
But young people themselves should take the first step. Do not leave it to too late. Make time, go out, meet new friends, join a dating agency, does not matter whether it’s SDU or whether it is a private one. You may find someone you are attracted to, then you can marry the person you love, and then you can love the person you marry.

Once couples are married, we like them to have children. We used to think this would follow naturally but this is no longer always the case because couples are having fewer children, having them later. Some prefer not to have any children at all. Why?
We look at other countries, we see it happening all over East Asia. I told you just now earlier. Confucian societies with similar cultural values undergoing very rapid transformation, social and economic change. So there are powerful social and cultural forces at work which are pushing us in the wrong direction. But it is not just happening in the east, Asian societies. It is happening in western societies too. In Australia, the government is working hard to encourage couples to have more kids. They have had the baby bonus, they have had tax incentives. They are introducing them now. They have quite a good slogan, “One for dad, one for mom, one for Australia”. Europe has this problem. Many countries facing a dearth of babies but there is something interesting in their experience. If you look at southern Europe, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain, the countries with more macho culture. The women are less liberated. They are more likely to stay at home, less chance to work, fewer babies. But in northern Europe, Netherlands, Scandinavia, where the gender roles are more equal, the women are more likely to work and yet there are more babies. This is very interesting. Gender roles and working are something which modern women put a lot of emphasis on.
So what is happening in Singapore? I discussed this when I met the women, married, single, young and not so young. They agreed that gender roles and helping mothers to work are important and they gave me many ideas on what we could do to facilitate this. So let me share some with you.
First of all, we have to share responsibilities for child-raising. Traditionally the husbands go to work, wear the pants, the wives stay at home, have the babies, take care of the babies. And it is true that the women have a better touch with children. But the situation today is different and the men can make the effort. If husbands leave everything to the wives, or the women are forced to choose between working or having babies, they are going to go on baby strike. So the husband has to share duties at home. I was discussing this with some MPs, including a lady MP and I said, you know, nowadays, I see men carrying babies in the markets when they go out. So she says, you think carrying babies is enough? You have got to wake up at night, feed the baby, change the nappies. I used to change nappies. In the days before pampers, you have actually got to fold the cloth, you got to put it on, you got to put the safety pin and I have not pricked any baby yet. If I can do it, that means everybody can do it and I think that you have to change these attitudes.
We cannot change these mindsets by making speeches but I think we can shift the ethos and spread it, maybe in schools, when it comes to domestic science, we must teach the boys also some of these skills. Try to influence them to have the right expectations. And share the responsibility. But in terms of things we can do and in terms of incentives, I think there are couple of small things.
We introduced childcare leave a few years ago which can be claimed by either parent. It is now only two days a year, I think we can push this to six days a year. I see that women are cheering. The men ought to cheer too. We will introduce one new thing. One week unpaid infant care leave per year, either parent until the child turns two years old. So first two years, if some things you need your infant to go for inoculation or some emergency, well, you can take some time off.
This is the first thing I learnt from the ladies. The second thing is that we must have a good work-life balance. You must have flexible work arrangements so that it is easier for women to have both, to work and to have children. And you must have family-friendly employers who will make this happen. So they make the practical arrangements and their attitudes when you go – they do not make a sour face and they do not make you feel there will be a little black mark recorded in your annual confidential report. It makes a big difference and with a bit of effort and imagination, you can do a lot. You can provide nursing rooms so that mothers who are lactating can express their milk and store their bottles. You can allow telecommuting and be flexible about it so long as the work is done. In fact, one company I know of actually allowed one employee to go all the way to Australia with her husband and telecommute from Australia, and continue to be paid and do the work and then she came back and she resumed her job. You can find ways around having them physically present. So one catering company which has a lot of outdoor catering over weekends, outside catering, supplied their staff with walkie-talkies and with Blackberries so that they do not have to be physically there, they can be with their family, they can go out but they can keep an eye on the catering arrangements, make sure things do not go wrong. I think such employers we should recognise and thank publicly, and MOM and MCYS will make a special effort to do that.
The government will help to share some of this burden of the employers. For example, maternity leave. We used to be eight weeks, we extended it by four weeks, now it is 12 and the extra four weeks, the government pays. I think it is been very much welcomed by people so now about three quarters of women actually take 12 weeks maternity leave. But if you ever manage a baby, you will know that actually 12 weeks is not very long. So I think what we should do is to increase it to 16 weeks. And this last four weeks, I think we give some flexibility. Do not make it necessarily all at the beginning, it can be any time in the first year and the government pays for this four weeks also.
But I would say whatever the leave arrangements and whatever the government carries, ultimately the woman or the man must make a personal choice. Do you work 110 per cent on your career or do you set aside time for other activities for a balanced life? I think each person has to decide his or her own point of balance.
I remember my own experience. I am a beneficiary of this. My mother was a lawyer but everyday, she came home to have lunch with us. So everyday we come home from school, three of us, my mother is there. We have lunch. Nowadays you would call it quality time.  This was before people invented such big words. All it meant was she had time for us. We had time to talk to her and it was a tremendous help. She avoided going out at night for functions. She had to go to accompany my father but business functions, very seldom. What it meant is less takings as a lawyer, less work, less conveyancing but she decided that her children were more important to her and she acted on that. And I think she was happy with that and we are definitely very grateful for that. Today, it is harder to do this. The office hours are longer, the pace is more intense, people call them ‘office hours’, you must put quotes there because it starts in the morning but it does not finish after dinner. And at home, you are working. On holidays you are working too, on email or Blackberry or whatever.
Despite this, I think you have to maintain a balanced fulfilling life and you have to keep a pace which is sustainable not just for one or two years and you burn out, but for a lifetime and you are in balance, equilibrium and at the end of your life or when you retire, you say I am satisfied, I have had a good career, I have taken care of my family, I have brought up children. This is what life is about.
Work-life balance also applies to the children. I know a lot of parents complain about stress on their children and especially complain because they say the education system causes the stress. We have trimmed the school syllabi – teach less, learn more. But parents still want their children to do that extra little bit more. So enrichment classes, tuition classes, all sorts of programmes and before exams, they feed the children chicken essence. So I see advertisements for chicken essence with kids in school uniforms, prominently displayed outside schools. I think some pressure is inevitable. It is part of Singapore's competitive spirit. Other East Asian societies are even more ruthlessly competitive. You look at the Koreans with their crammed schools or the Japanese, they havejukusI think they call them, the Hong Kongers. I just read one article about the Koreans. They go there, they inspect your bags, no frivolous magazines, no handphones, no lipstick. You go in, no making friends with boys and girls, it's like a prison. And everyday they have one hour of rest, every week they have two hours on the weekend to get into the right university.
We are not like that. We have some stress but we should manage it, we should take it in our stride. It is natural for parents to worry about children and to encourage them to work hard and do better. But we also need to understand them, to know that every child has different aptitudes, different talents, to give them space to grow up, to let them learn and mature in their own time. Press them to do better but also know them and let them develop the way their nature inclines them to develop. In many directions, may not be academic, may be sports, may be arts, may be music, but let them go with their nature.
Third thing which I learnt from the women is about the financial cost of having kids. Actually I did not need to learn this from women, I knew about this. It is a significant expense to bring up children. First the direct child-raising expenses, the milk powder, the pram, the paediatrician, all those things cost money. But on top of the direct cost, you also have to think about the opportunity costs for working mothers particularly and for professional mothers especially. What do I mean by opportunity costs? When the mother is working, she is earning money. When she is looking after the child and she has to work less or less intensively, she has to forgo some income there to look after the child. So her income has come down some so that is called opportunity cost. Less work, sacrifice their careers. And that is why often it is the professional women, the most successful ones who say that it is expensive to bring up children. So paradoxically, the lower-income women feel less opportunity cost but higher income women feel it so and say so.
Financial considerations cannot be the motive for having children. I think if you suggest to a couple that I give you a bit of discount, how about having more kids, I think many would be very indignant at this and rightly so. But it is right for us to help women to lighten the burden of having children and that is why we had the baby bonus, that is why we had a tax incentive and we will enhance these schemes. I do not have the details tonight, so you watch the next instalment, but for the baby bonus we will improve it for the first time parents. For the tax incentives, we will do more in order to encourage mothers to work.
The fourth thing which the women asked me to focus on is early childhood arrangements. This is a major concern of parents especially if both parents are working. The critical period is from birth to six years when they go to school. Because after they have gone to school, they are in primary one. Well, they are mostly taken care of and also a little bit bigger, able to look after themselves. But before they reach school, the first six years, those are critical and you want to have that peace of mind that they are being looked after well. Most families take care of children at home, either the grandparents keep an eye on them or they have extended family or they have maids.  But many working mothers depend on formal childcare arrangements and one quarter of children of this age are in childcare centres and the most popular centres have got queues. You wait one year, sometimes more before you get in.
So I visited one, NTUC childcare in Jurong which is one of the popular ones. Very impressed with what they were doing. Talked to some of the parents who came in the evening to pick their kids up and to meet me. They were very happy to have their kids there. Good environment, they will socialise, they learned skills, social skills, dancing, they were preparing for national day, they were making models, learning to interact with other kids, get along with other kids, and the parents had peace of mind while they were working.  So I think that we should do more to build up the childcare sector. It is important. I think we should do three things. Make it more accessible, that means more centres. Make it more affordable, that means bigger subsidies per child. Make it higher quality, raise the standard, so that we can work with this. That way, we will have a better quality childcare centre and we will able to work.
The kindergartens are another thing which we must do to improve. Not everybody goes to childcare centre but nearly everybody goes to kindergarten. And we have a very lively kindergarten sector in Singapore. At the high end, I think they can look after themselves, at the middling end, mass market, the PAP Community Foundation centres, standards have improved but I think they can do better. I think that we should put a lot more effort into enhancing the kindergarten sector as well because it is important for our kids to have a good kindergarten preparation when they go to school. You do not want the kindergartens to be a pre-pre-school. So when you go to primary one, you are already pressured before you reach primary one, you have pre-pressured. You have competition to get into the kindergarten but you want a good kindergarten environment. And I think that we should be able to do that. We have got already government spending money on the kindergartens because qualifying institutions are getting subventions and help from MOE. I think we should push this up substantially. So that we can raise the standard, we can raise not just better teachers which we are doing. We can have better syllabuses, better run institutions, higher quality environment so the kids grow up much more confident and particularly for those whose backgrounds are not so ideal at home, they will be able to make it in kindergarten and start from a more equal starting point when they go to school.
This is a big move. We have deliberated this over a long time. We did not decide because our cut-off point was at primary one. I think our cut-off point mainly should still be at primary one but we should begin to do more before kids reach primary one so that we can prepare them for life and for school. Those are four big things which we need to do.
There are two more small things which we will also do which do not affect a lot of people but I think we should do. It is right. One, couples who want to have children but cannot conceive. They go for IVF but it is expensive. So we will offer financial support to lower the costs of the IVF. Secondly, couples with many children. There was a letter in the Straits Times, I think there were five mothers each of whom had five kids, who said remember us and we have five children, your incentives stop at four. So I think we should remember them and I think we should extend most of the incentives like tax relief, childcare subsidies and so on to the fifth and the subsequent child. There are not many of them. But I hope the incentives will encourage those who can afford to have more.
These measures all add up to a very significant package. We are talking about maybe $700 million a year. If more babies are born, it is going to be more than $700 million a year but even that is about double what we are spending today on child incentives. And altogether we’ll have about $1.6 billion spent a year or 0.6 per cent of GDP. Wong Kan Seng is in charge of population policies, so he will have a press conference later this week and he will give you the full picture, including the numbers which I think many parents will be anxiously waiting. But please do not wait for the press conference to pay attention.
This package will make a difference to many couples but I cannot guarantee that it will solve our problems because this is a deep problem. We have to come back to this, revisit it periodically. Finally it is about mindsets, personal choices and values. Please put emphasis on marriage, on family, make these your priorities, have a full and happy life.
I have got a message. We have lost 0-3. We were up against a very strong China team. I think they have done us proud. We should congratulate them and we should rejoice and celebrate.
Our children will grow up in a completely different world and we have to prepare them and Singapore society for this world. One of the biggest changes that will affect us is the Internet. The new media is pervasive and fast moving. Everyone is plugged in and connected. People are blogging, engaging one another, organising themselves online, doing politics online. We used to talk about grassroots, now we have to think about Netroots, people on the Internet and it is happening worldwide.
You look at America, the current election campaign. John McCain says I do not know how to use the computer, I have no email, but he has a website on the Internet. He has to, John McCain.com, this is John McCain’s website.
Barack Obama. He uses a blackberry, constantly texting, communicating, emailing and the Internet is a key part of his campaign. He has got a powerful simple homepage, “Change we can believe in” and he has used it effectively to reach out to younger Americans to get them highly energised and participating and rooting for him and helping him to run the system. He has got Chris Hughes, Chris Hughes is one of the founders of Facebook, 24 years old, I suppose must be worth a few hundred million dollars now, dropped out of university. He joined Barack Obama to help, used Facebook technology to organise his campaign, his volunteers, his events, his donations, his activities, his appearances, his emails, the whole lot. Therefore Barack Obama has a Facebook presence which you can see and like all of his pages, there is one very interesting button on it which is bright red – Donate now. And very powerful because people are taken up by this and 1.5 million people have clicked that button and each one donates small amounts but altogether adding to about a hundred million, maybe more by now. Cumulatively, a huge boost to his campaign, so much so that he can say I do not want government money, I am going on my grassroots money. But it is still money. But Barack Obama also runs into trouble on the Internet because all sorts of stories go on. Like he is a Muslim or he did not do this or he did that and he cannot go around fighting untruths all over the Internet everywhere. What he has done is to collect all these untruths together to make one website which is called Fight the Smears. John McCain attacks him for not visiting wounded troops and then there is a rebuttal. And if you go in, a whole list of all the things which are untrue and all the explanations according to Barack Obama’s campaign. He is using the internet but he is also running into some of the difficulties of using the Internet. This is America.
Let me take another country nearer here, Korea, in Asia. It is the world’s most wired country, mostest broadband, mostest usage, people do everything on the Internet and it has had a huge impact on Korean politics. It has empowered new groups because they mobilise and they activate on the Internet. So it helped President Lee Myung-bak in his election campaign last December to win a resounding victory because on the Internet people could mobilise and new groups could form but on the Internet you also have rapidly changing moods in the population. So within a few months after being elected, President Lee was under siege and there were mass demonstrations. They said million man demonstrations, maybe a slight exaggeration but if you look at the picture, it looks huge. This is a candlelight picture in Seoul. What were they agitated about, Mad Cow Disease. Facts? Actually rumours, fantastic rumours. The first rumour, 94 per cent of Koreans have a special gene. When they eat beef, they will get mad cow disease. That went around. Everybody got excited. Calmed down, next rumour – Cow products are used to make pampers. Babies wear pampers, babies will get mad cow disease. Videos and pictures circulated online. This is a real event. Here is another one. There are some even ruder which I thought I should not show you tonight but you can find them. Then from the internet it comes back, people get agitated, demonstrations go back on the Internet again. President Lee Myung-bak calls this info-demics. Anonymous false information, create discontent and unhappiness, spread like an epidemic in the real world. But President Lee calls it info-demics. One Korean newspaper who does not have to be so careful with its words, calls it mad cow madness. That is Korea, that is a negative example.
Malaysia is another interesting example where the Internet has become an active space for information and engagement. There is lively debate, serious contributions but also more doubtful stuff. There are blogs, chatrooms, there are alternative news sites, like Malaysiakini which is very popular and I know many Singaporeans visit it and it has quite a lot of news. The politicians themselves actively participate in cyberspace. Dr Mahathir has a blog now. He uses the name Che Det. He started in politics and he went in to have a blog. Other people start with blogs and then go into politics. You heard about Jeff Ooi? Famous blogger, stood for election, elected. In the recent elections, there was a mass of material circulating, Blogs, SMSes, Youtube and the public went to cyber space to get what they could not get from the mainstream media. The opposition was there, all over. I show you Anwar Ibrahim’s website, pictures of him, videos of him. BN also has a website like that and so the battle went on in cyberspace. It was not just cyber space, of course. There was also real life politics in Malaysia because the opposition raised many hot issues in theirceramahs, in their meetings, rising cost of living, poor public service delivery and perceived inequalities in the government’s policies, to put it delicately. But these were issues which were picked up in the new media and then virally distributed, one shares with two, two share with four and it multiplies and everybody gets the message and the result was 8thMarch when the elections were held.
Even in China, which has the world’s largest number of Internet users, more than America, the Internet has become an important factor. After the Sichuan earthquake, Netizens mobilized to raise funds and show support for the victims. I show you one slide “重建家园，中国力量” and it had an impact on the mood and the sense of patriotism and unity which the Chinese developed after the Sichuan earthquake. Their leaders are now engaging on the new media and President Hu Jintao had his first web chat recently, answered a few questions.
These are other countries. In Singapore, the new media is also quite a big thing. I talked about this two years ago but in two years we have moved on since then. Today more than 80 per cent of households have broadband. There are six million handphones in Singapore. You think about that, 4.5 million people, six million handphones, more handphones per couple than babies. No wonder no time to have babies. But the young people are totally immersed in this medium. They are reading the print newspapers less, they are getting information, discussing issues online. The Straits Times website, people are participating, CNA website, same. Zaobao has OMY, also very interesting, new approach to presenting the news and engaging the audience and people are writing their own contents, sharing it with others, organizing interest groups.
All this has changed the way the government works. Our services have gone online 24/7. You want a passport renewal, you can do that, you want to incorporate a new business, set up a new company, 20 minutes, it is done. You want to pay your taxes, IRAS, no trouble. And the government is also communicating and engaging with Singaporeans online. We are not just pumping out stuff, we have some quite interesting stuff which we are pumping out, we have some video clips, I think MDA is showing the way. Some of you may remember Christopher Chia, who is a CEO, turns out he is a very good hip-hop dancer. But also two-way engagement and participation. And REACH is at the forefront of that. They need to engage people. So they have got a website which is popular and they have got blogs, online chats and so on and they also participate on Facebook. And you get quite a lot of participation. For my rally today, I got a lot of feedback from REACH and the subjects which I am talking about are the subjects which are hot on REACH. So we look at their homepage, what do you find? Rising costs of living. Hot topics.
So that is the way the government works, that is the way Singaporeans work and that is the way we will have to adjust in order to conduct our politics. We have to adapt to this, get used to this, turn it to positive effect, use it to inform, to educate, engage people. And each of us has to learn. It is not something which you learn to mouse click, you are there. You must learn how to be savvy, cyber citizens. Do not get taken in, be discerning about what you see on the internet. When people say click here, check first before you click. When people say this is true, do not just send it to all your friends. Ask first, is this true? Set prudent limits so that we can flag problems and we know where the dangerous ground is. Participate actively by all means, but do not get swept away and please do not catch mad cow madness.
Our rules governing politics also must keep up to date. First of all party political films. That means films about political matters. Right now they are totally banned and for a reason because politics is a serious affair. We want voters to consider issues, rationally, coolly, detached, think through decisions which affect your future and make a considered judgment. And our worry is that films are an emotive medium. The impact of seeing something on a film is quite different from reading something in cold print. It hits you viscerally, it affects you, engages your emotions before your thinking processes can kick in and if you are watching it in a crowd, even more powerful. Then, passions can get stirred up and people can get carried away. I think this is a valid concern, but I do not think an outright ban is still sensible because this is how people communicate on the web in daily life. They make videos, they pass clips around, you saw the clips just now from the Flying Dutchman, even my NDR, National Day Rally Speech, it is now National Day Rally multimedia super show. Has to be because that is the way you have to communicate and after the speech, videos, blog responses and people make these things. Anybody can do this any time, anywhere.
We encourage more citizens to engage in debate, to participate in building our shared future and we will progressively open up our system even more.PM Lee Hsien Loong

Let me show you. I have a handphone here, it is an ordinary Nokia handphone. It is a handphone which has a little programme loaded in it called QIK. And what QIK does is to turn this handphone into a video camera. If I click it, it will turn on, become a video camera and furthermore it will stream the picture immediately onto the Internet, onto my website. So if I turn on the camera now, I am filming you now, you look on my website, you can see yourself. I think we must make sure we see the upstairs people too. Slight delay, but it works. So please wave, you are on candid camera. There you are, simple as that. I have just made our first non-political video.
So we have got to allow political videos, but with some safeguards. Some things are obviously alright, factual footage, documentaries, recordings of live events, I think National Day Rally, surely no problem. But I think some things should still be off limits. If you make a political commercial which is purely made-up material, partisan stuff, footage distorted to create a slanted impression, I think those should still be off limits. In between, what is okay and what is not okay, there will be grey areas, but I think we can deal with this, just as we deal with it for non-political films, we have censorship, we have classification standards, it depends on subjective judgments, but we have worked out a workable system, a panel applies their minds, they make a judgment. I think we can work something out, but the overriding consideration is to preserve the integrity and the quality and the honesty of our political discourse. Keep it straight, keep it serious, think carefully about serious matters which concern our lives.
The second thing we should change are the rules for political material which can be put on to the internet during elections. The rules we now have were settled before the last general elections. So for example, and they are very restrictive, no podcasts, no video casts and most people cannot post materials during the election period. Only the parties, only the candidates, the agents can do that.
By the next general election, five years will have passed. Now, cyber years are like dog years. One year in cyberspace equals to seven years in real life. That is the pace at which things change. So five years times seven means 35 years in the real world, means our old rules are way, way out of date. That means we have to change to new rules, liberalise to allow people to participate more actively and flexibly. So we must allow podcast, video cast, must allow others to post election materials also, but we have to maintain or try to maintain accountability and responsibility, somehow. It is not easy to do this. Do not think that other countries do not face these problems, they do. The Koreans are very exercised about this. Every time I meet them I exchange notes with them. They ask us how we intend to deal with it and I ask them how they are dealing with it. They do not have an answer, but it is a real problem.
We have an Advisory Council on the Impact of New Media on Society, AIMS. Mr Cheong Yip Seng is chairing it and they are studying these issues in detail, they have been thinking about this I think for quite many months now. I look forward to seeing their recommendations. But let me say that beyond cyberspace, politics is about people’s lives in the real world. You cannot vote for an avatar on second life. You are talking about real life, not second life. You have to get a direct feel for the person. Do you trust him, is he capable, is he honest, will he wilt? So you have got to talk, you have got to argue, you have got to persuade. And then you have got to mobilise and work together for what you together believe in and you cannot just do this online, reading emails or even listening to podcast or watching vodcast. You have to do it face-to-face and we do this all the time. Grassroots sessions, dialogues, meetings. We are a small society, so it is possible for us to interact and get to know one another well. You cannot have make belief because the prime minister is just an image on the screen, everybody will know he is just an image on the screen. He has to be here in real life and you have to feel the person and then you will know. So that is how politics has to be done. We have a few restraints because we cannot afford to take chance with race and religion but by and large Singaporeans are free to engage, to talk, to mobilise, to influence one another, to do nearly everything, especially indoors where we lifted the limits a few years go.
There is one remaining restriction and that is on outdoor demonstrations. We still do not allow this and our concern is law and order and security. It comes back to race and religion again because one incident could undermine our racial harmony and confidence in Singapore. But again like political videos, valid concern but we have to move away from this total ban and find ways to allow people to let off steam a little bit more but safely. How?
We have Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park. While they find the location accessible, near the MRT, not so many speakers but if you want to go there, there is place. Just put your name down and you can speak. So I think we should allow our outdoor public demonstrations, also at the Speakers’ Corner still subject to basic rules of law and order, still stay away from race, language and religion. I think we will still call it Speakers’ Corner, no need to call it demonstrators’ corner but we will manage with a light touch. So I think there is no need for the police to get involved. We will hand this over. Mah Bow Tan has agreed. NParks will take over. NParks, you know they have green fingers, everything will grow nicely, it will be well in hand. I think we should look into online registration for Speakers’ Corner. So you do not have to go to their office.
The overall thrust of these changes is to liberalise our society, to widen the space for expression and participation. We encourage more citizens to engage in debate, to participate in building our shared future and we will progressively open up our system even more. If you compare today with five years ago or ten years ago, it is much more open today and we will continue to feel our way forward. We cannot just progress by copying others blindly. We have got to think through our own problems, ourselves, find the right path for Singapore, crossing a river by feeling for the stones step by step, as Deng Xiaoping said. But please remember, even in the cyber age, some things do not change. In 50 years’ time, Singapore will still be a little red dot. To thrive as a nation, we will still need the cohesion to stay united, the ability to outperform others and the will to survive and excel and occasionally, win medals. That means a hardworking and well-educated population, a capable effective government, outstanding people at all levels, totally committed to Singapore. Then however the world changes, our children will still have a bright future. Before I leave this subject on new media, I want to do one more demonstration.
PM: “Hello Team Singapore”.
Mr Tan Eng Liang: “Good evening, PM.”
PM: “Hello, Eng Liang.”
Mr Tan: “Yes, I am the Chef de Mission of the Singapore Olympic Team in Beijing. Sorry PM, we just lost the gold medal to China. They are a better team with better skills and techniques but our paddlers tried their best and they did play well.”
PM: “Thank you, we heard the results earlier. I shared it with my audience earlier. Our paddlers have done very well and they have done Singapore proud. Please thank them from us. Jiawei, Tianwei, Yuegu, but also the whole Team Singapore in Beijing. You have done us proud, you have carried our flag high.”
Mr Tan: “Yes, they will do that. Thank you Prime Minister for we will I think carry on with flag of Singapore and I think with this silver medal, we have achieved the objective. Thank you for your messages.”
PM: “Thank you, send our greetings and congratulations to the team.”
Mr Tan: “Yes, I will do that.”
PM: “Good night, Eng Liang.”
PM: That was my last special effects for tonight.
I have discussed some key issues that affect our future. Immediate concerns like inflation, cost of living, long-term issues, living graciously, raising families, opening up our society. We have got to get these right to keep our economy growing year after year. Sometimes, people criticise us for putting too much emphasis on economic performance because GDP growth, employment, productivity and so on, they appear just as so many statistics, so many numbers, decimal places but actually growth is critical. It gives us the resources to solve our problems. It creates opportunities for our workers to secure better jobs, for our young to receive a first-class education, for all of us to improve our lives and fulfil our dreams. So it is not just abstract numbers, it’s changing people’s lives for the better. It is about the Singapore story as lived in the lives of all of us.
Let us work hard, grow our economy, transform the nation, then we will create even more extraordinary opportunities for the new generation.PM Lee Hsien Loong

The older generation of Singaporeans have experienced this. So take for example, Mr Arumugam Jeyapal who works for PSA. He has had PSLE plus two years of vocational training, that is all. He started as a prime-mover driver earning $250 a month, worked his way up over the years, now he is 58 years old, mentor to yard crane operators, earning $3,000 a month and active in the union. Over the years, he has upgraded from a three-room flat to a five-room flat. He has three children, and they are doing well in different fields. One is a soccer coach, one is a lawyer in the AG Chambers, a DPP, a daughter is studying in NIE to become a teacher. He is now 58. So he says “I have lived the Singapore Story, I am grateful for what the government has provided.”
Middle-age Singaporeans have also seen this. I give you another example, Madam Lim Hwee Bin, who is a wafer fab specialist. Here you see her all togged up. Her face is uncovered because otherwise you cannot see but she is working in the Clean Room. She quit her job a few years ago to help her daughter who was not doing well in school. Then her daughter studies improved, she returned to work full-time as a machine operator at Seagate, night shift, OT to supplement the wage but her friends told her she could get a better job at the wafer fab but she did not have alobang. So how to find the job at the wafer fab? So she resigned, she responded to an ad for e2i. e2i is NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute. And she went there and the e2i helped here to equip herself with new skills and she joined ST Microelectronics as a wafer fab specialist. Now, she is earning $1,400 a month, nearly a third more than before. So at 45, it is not so easy with children but she has made the career switch successfully to a new job with brighter prospects. Her daughter is doing well, now in Singapore Poly studying to become an optometrist. That means learning to measure eyes for spectacles. I think there is a brilliant future in Singapore. So many of us are speckies.
Young Singaporeans are writing their own Singapore Stories too. They enjoy far more opportunities than their parents ever did. I have this group - Crystalline Tan, Neng Abdul Rashid, David Aw – three of them. SMU graduates, fresh out of school, gone to Dubai, recruited by Fullerton Financial Holdings (a Temasek company). And they are taking risks venturing seizing opportunities and launched off onto an international career.
Or this young man, Mohamad Fadzuli. He is not here this evening. He is a computer games enthusiast. He was addicted to computer games as a boy. So I think he must have caused his mother a lot of stress but he went to Nanyang Poly, he did a diploma in entertainment technology, he topped his class. He applied to Carnegie Mellon University in the US, which is the one of the best universities for computer games. And they took him, they gave him advance standing, they waived the undergraduate degree, he has gone in to do a Masters. And he got an MDA-ST Electronics Scholarship. So now he is on a three-month attachment at Disney. He is not on holiday there. At least I do not think so. He is at Disney because Disney has a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon and he is helping them to develop a new computer game.
Or take this young lady, Brenda Tan. She is a marketing manager. In school, she was playful and lazy. ‘O’ level results not so good but she went to ITE, then she went to Ngee Ann Poly for a Diploma in Business. She got a job at Citibank as a tele-sales officer. She did well and was promoted. She was posted to Malaysia to set up a new unit there and she became the manager of the unit, managing 80 people on her staff. She came back to Singapore and now she is progressing in her career. And she says, I should read this because you should hear this. “ITE has given many opportunities to people like me who are less academically inclined. This is something unique about our education system and about the openness and acceptance of our society.”
They are not all here but several of them are here – Mr Arumugam, Brenda and Madam Lim. Some of them are overseas so I think that we should thank them for living the Singapore Story. This is what we mean when we talk about growth, about investing in our people, about thinking long-term. This is what drives us to do the best for Singapore whatever the uncertainties and difficulties. So let us look beyond our immediate problems, let us work hard, grow our economy, transform the nation, then we will create even more extraordinary opportunities for the new generation and together, our children will write more chapters of our Singapore Story.
Goodnight!

   singaporewebsite update april",15209,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed several key areas of focus for the nation, including economic challenges, rising costs of living, and the need for societal and political adaptation to new media and technologies.

**Economic Focus:**
The Prime Minister acknowledged that while Singapore's economy had been performing well, allowing the government to focus on social issues, current global economic conditions necessitated a renewed focus on economic strategies. He highlighted past successful projects that have contributed to economic momentum, such as the F1 Grand Prix and developments in financial services. However, he also noted the external economic challenges posed by situations in the US and Europe, which are impacting Singapore, particularly in sectors like manufacturing and tourism.

**Cost of Living and Inflation:**
Rising costs of living, particularly due to higher oil and food prices, were identified as major concerns for Singaporeans. The Prime Minister discussed the global nature of these issues and the limited capacity of the government to control such external factors. He outlined measures taken to mitigate these impacts, including financial assistance through schemes like U-Save and efforts to keep the economy competitive to maintain or improve living standards despite these challenges.

**Adaptation to New Media:**
The speech also covered the significant impact of new media on society and politics. The Prime Minister emphasized the need for the political system and societal norms to adapt to the realities of a digital age where engagement, information dissemination, and public discourse increasingly occur online. He proposed liberalizing regulations around political films and online content, especially during election periods, to better reflect contemporary communication practices while ensuring responsible use of these platforms.

**Social Issues and Initiatives:**
The Prime Minister reiterated the government's commitment to addressing social issues such as the income gap, aging population, and housing needs. He highlighted ongoing efforts to support lower and middle-income families, including enhancements to public assistance and housing programs.

In conclusion, the speech outlined Singapore's proactive approach to navigating economic challenges, addressing the rising cost of living, and adapting to technological advancements in media, all while continuing to focus on critical social issues. The government's strategies involve both immediate relief measures and long-term planning to ensure stability and growth in changing global conditions."
2009,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, this is a significant year for Singapore . It is the 50th anniversary of our self-government. It is also the year when we have been hit by the most serious recession in half a century. Day to day we watch keenly the economic numbers - growth data, unemployment data, trade data, all the statistics. It is like monitoring the temperature chart of an H1N1 patient.
But we need to step back and see things in the longer perspective. Over the last five decades we have met many challenges successfully. And when we started out, we had much less than we have today.
Singapore achieved self-government on the 3rd of June 1959. That evening, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his new PAP team held a huge rally on the Padang. And MM spoke. He told the crowd: ""Once in a long while in the history of a people there comes a moment of great change. And tonight is such a moment in our lives.""
It was quite a different mood from tonight's National Day Rally. It was a moment of great excitement. And it was also indeed the start of a long period of enormous change for Singapore . In the course of the next 50 years, we developed our economy, we created jobs for Singaporeans, we housed and educated our population, and we forged our different communities into one united people.
And therefore, we are quite confident that we will overcome this present economic challenge. We need to tackle the immediate situation. But we also must also look ahead to the longer term. And provided we can do both, our future is bright. How can we do this? Tonight, I will talk about four issues: the economy, healthcare, harmony in our society and shaping Singapore together. Let me start with the economy.
The global economic crisis has been a major challenge for us. The first hint of this was two national days ago when it was just one little black cloud on the horizon. And as we prepared the National Day messages, we inserted a warning, just to tell people, watch out, keep an eye open.
So we are producing game programmers, visual effects artists, computer graphics artists, all in demand. It is still young, a green shoot, but it has produced some quite impressive work. LucasFilms made one production here from concept to completion. It is called 'Clone Wars: Jedi Alliance'. This is Yoda [picture]. If you know about Star Wars, you will know who he is. I think we will produce more of such movies and this should grow into another interesting segment of our economy.
We are also attracting MNCs to Singapore still. They are using this downtime to think deeply about their future. They are keen to do more in Singapore , in Asia, which they see as a key growth engine for the world and they see Singapore as a base for them to do their Asia business. So EDB has been engaging these companies in strategic dialogue, to encourage them to put their high-end manufacturing, their headquarters operations, their 'control tower' functions here to service the region. Control tower like Changi Airport's control tower, tracking what is happening all over Asia, logistics, money, manpower, research or production, the whole lot. And EDB is working out with them on 5 to 10-year plans.
For example Rolls Royce – they make jet engines, marine engines. They moved their marine division global headquarters to Singapore this year, not just an Asian headquarters but for that part of the business - their global headquarters, controlling things all over the world — is based in Singapore . And they are also building a facility here to test and assemble Trent aero engines and a plant to manufacture the fan blades.
This is the engine which they are making in Singapore . It is meant for their big wide-body jets, so if you are on an Airbus 380, you may have one of these. It is taller than the man and the fan blades, these massive things, are high-tech products which they are going to make here. We will have their first factory outside the UK to do it. And it is going to give us 500 mostly skilled jobs when fully operational, in Seletar Aviation Park.
So we are getting good projects, long term projects here and one key benefit and one key strength we have in attracting these projects, is the Singapore brand name. It benefits local companies when they go overseas because they say, you are from Singapore , I can depend on you. And it gives overseas companies confidence when they come here and invest here. So we should never compromise or lose this advantage.
It is not just a name but it depends on a united people, best workforce in the world, good leadership, first class government. When companies like Rolls Royce decide to site projects here and put a plant here, they spent years to study and decide. They are really betting on Singapore , not just for five or 10 years, but for the next 20 or 30 years. In other words, the next four, five or six elections. So take it seriously.
As we transform our economy workers will need to update and adapt themselves. The government is spending millions of dollars on programmes to help workers to do this, to upgrade within their jobs, and if they have lost jobs, to help them to become job-ready, to learn new skills, and to find new jobs.
The facilities are all there. The programmes are there. Please take advantage of these opportunities if you are out of a job, even if you are in a job. Do not wait till you are unemployed. It may mean effort, it may mean a mindset change. But we have programmes even to help people to make this mindset change, to overcome the psychological hurdles, to rebuild their self-confidence, improve their interview skills and to give one another, encouragement and moral support. I have a picture here and this is a programme, PMET career workshop, run by one of the CDCs. And I have watched the participants. It takes a while to overcome the shyness, the embarrassment, the awkwardness to let your hair down, to speak and to be prepared to take a new path. But it is worthwhile and it is productive.
Let me just quote you one example from Northwest CDC career centre. This was a person, Mr Mohd Amin, who was 48 years old and he was retrenched. And he went for help. And this is what he told us afterwards.
""After the retrenchment, I feared I cannot find another job because of my age...all interviews I attended were unsuccessful for three months. I was very worried as I am sole breadwinner with three schooling children. The career centre coached me to learn a skill and start a new career path. I felt supported. I attended the job placement event and I successfully found a job as an Enforcement Specialist. The training allowed me to do my job confidently. I am doing well. I am so happy now as I am earning more than before.""
And finally the message:
""I will ask my friends to go to career centre for support and help. Tell them to be flexible and not choosy.""
That is a real message. I think it is a convincing one. We should invest in this and do more. And we will enhance the training infrastructure to support continuous training and re-training which we will need to continue to do even after the recession.
We have currently almost 50 training centres scattered all across the island. They are in great demand. Many of them are bursting at the seams. So we will invest more and build two national Continuing Education and Training campuses. One will be the East Campus at Paya Lebar Central. The other one is the West Campus at Jurong Lake District. They are next to MRT stations, and convenient for workers. And they will become one-stop shops for training and retraining, and job matching. And I think we will be able to get even more workers helped and trained. The Ministry of Manpower will give you more details later on.
Because of the way we have responded comprehensively and decisively to this downturn, we can be confident of our future. It is a deep trough, but we are coping with it. It has taken quite long. It may take some time more. But eventually the global economy will turn around, and Asia will sustain its recovery. And by then, our new strategies, our new investments, our workers' upgrading would all have taken effect. And we will be ready to pick up strongly again.
We are preparing for our long-term future by strengthening our social safety nets. After food and shelter, I think good health is one of the most important basic requirements which human beings have. It is more important than money. Singaporeans know that we have good doctors, good hospitals. Their worry is whether they can afford it, especially in the future after they grow old and retire.
We have done many things to mitigate this worry. We have a 3M (Medisave, MediShield, Medifund) system designed precisely to keep healthcare affordable to all, even and especially, the lower income group. And we have steadily improved and upgraded and extended the 3M system so Medisave now covers long term outpatient treatment, MediShield now provides higher insurance payouts, Medifund –we have increased the amounts, it is giving more help to the needy to settle their outstanding hospital bills.
So as a result, MPs see fewer cases of residents unable to afford healthcare, and medical social workers report that the Medifund is adequate to cover hospital bills. We will continue to improve this and to widen the 3Ms progressively but we have to do it carefully because we want to keep the system working and there are pitfalls.
But I know that Singaporeans are still concerned. We see medical science advancing, we see new technologies, new drugs, new procedures. People can live longer, but it costs more. And those who are in their 50s looking after aged parents, they feel the burden and they wonder “what will happen to me when my turn comes?”. They asked, “I am all right now, what about the future?” We need to gear up our healthcare systems to prepare for this ageing population and we are doing that.
So today I would like to explain the implications of our ageing population and how we are preparing our healthcare system to cope. What does it mean when we say our population will be older? It means there will be more demand on healthcare because older people are sick more often.
But this also means it is a different pattern of healthcare. Younger patients do not go to hospital so often. When they go to hospital it is an acute problem which can be treated within a few days and then they go home well. I remember I was admitted to hospital once as a teenager for an appendicitis operation and my doctor who was a wise old man said, “I am so happy to treat you because you are a young man, I treat you, you will go home well. When I treat my older patients, I see them, they get better, after a while they come back again and I have to treat them again. It is much more complicated.”
But now we have many more older patients who are admitted more frequently with multiple complaints. After a few days in hospital their acute condition probably has stabilised, they no longer need intensive and complex treatment but they are still not well enough to go home. You may not need to have the heart monitor, you may not need to have the blood or oxygen monitor, you may not need to have the nurse look at your every two hours or the doctor look at you twice or three times a day but you are not quite ready to go home and you still need several weeks to recuperate and to get better before you can be discharged.
After they go home they may still need continuing medication for underlying long-term conditions. Maybe they have diabetes, maybe they have heart disease, they may need aspirin, they may need statins. There are so many things which you have to take not just when you are sick but for the rest of your life. And even when you are at home, you may get sick again and you may have to come back again.
So we have to respond to this by putting in more resources into our hospital system, building new hospitals. We got the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) coming up in Yishun, we have got Jurong General Hospital coming up in the west, and that is good. Well, the buildings are easy to do, but getting the people to man them, the doctors, nurses, specialists, physiotherapists, that takes more doing but we are in the process of doing that. It needs money. We are in the process of increasing the budget too. We need to improve our 3M system. We are doing that too.
All these are necessary but by itself, more money is not the full solution to the problem. Because we also have to get the whole system to be structured properly so that it will be adapted to cater to the ageing population. To structure it properly means we need step-down care. What is step-down care? I think Khaw Boon Wan has been talking about this for some time but let me explain it again because it is a vital idea and a crucial part of our solution. Step-down care means slow medicine: community hospitals, nursing homes, GPs doing more work, home care - people taking care of sick people at home. Organised properly all this can provide competent, appropriate care especially for the elderly patients. Step-down care today is provided mostly by VWOs (Voluntary Welfare Organisations). They do an excellent job but they will need government help to deal with more elderly patients.
And one key thing we must do with this step-down care is to link up our acute hospitals - Tan Tock Seng, and so on with community hospitals, so that you can have the best of both worlds. Patients are sick can go to the acute hospitals, where they get “fast medicine” - ICU, MRI, surgery, all the intensive intervention and high-tech medicine. Then after they get better, they go to the community hospitals — Ren Ci, St Andrew’s where there are doctors and nurses who can look after the patients and you have physiotherapy and occupational therapy and rehab but they do not need the high-end medicine. The patients go there, they receive “slow medicine”, they take some time, get well enough to go home. If in the “slow medicine” place, you need “fast medicine”, you shift back to the acute hospital, and the doctor can see to you.
And that way you get appropriate care, you save money and we also free up beds in the acute hospitals for more cases which need to be admitted. This is all in principle but just to understand what it really meant, I decided to go and have a look for myself. So I went to visit the new which is co-located with Tan Tock Seng. And in this picture you can see Ren Ci on the left and Tan Tock Seng in the background, on the right hand side and behind. Ren Ci has a new management and they are working with Tan Tock Seng to realise this new arrangement. Tan Tock Seng will guide the medical care of patients at Ren Ci. The two hospitals will be connected together soon with a bridge so you can just wheel the patients across, without need for an ambulance. Ren Ci will maintain its community outreach. It has got many volunteers and these volunteers do a very valuable job helping to keep patients active and happy. And here you see (in this picture) the volunteers helping the elderly lady to get her muscles control and built up again, practising fishing for something, and cheering her up.
So I think Tan Tock Seng - Ren Ci is a good model. Other acute hospitals should also tie up with community hospitals in the same way. Changi General Hospital is already partnering St Andrew’s in the east. We will build similar sister community hospitals to match in the north and to match in the west. And this arrangement will draw on the strengths of both parties - government professional teams delivering high quality care and VWOs, good at pastoral care and community outreach.
But the community hospitals cannot be the end of the story because you cannot stay in the hospital forever, you must go home. You want to go home. And patients are best discharged home as soon as possible so that they can be with their families, so that they can be in familiar surroundings. They will be more comfortable, happier; much better and cheaper than leaving them in the hospital. I think families want this too but at the same time, families tell us they need some help and support at home. Very often they need caregivers and maids. And the caregivers and maids may need some professional training to look after the seniors. They could require nurses to visit them more frequently, check on the patient's condition and refer back to doctors in the hospital if necessary.
Nowadays nurses can do many things: the nurse comes, attaches the sensors, reads an ECG, emails back to the doctor, the doctor can make a reading and then adjust the prescription or if need be, call the patient back. Home Nursing Foundation is doing good work in this respect and I think they need to ramp up, as we need more of this. GPs need to do more things with patients at home, monitoring and supervising their care.
So we want people at home. We would like to help you to have your patients at home and we are working on upgrading home care. It is one of Ministry of Health’s priorities. This is not sexy, glamorous medicine but this is how we can help Singaporeans look after their elderly, look after ourselves when we are elderly, look after our healthcare costs. We have to think about the whole system, provide the right treatment at the right place to patients with different needs. So I hope that doctors will give full support to this. I hope the step-down care providers and VWOs will also work together with this because they are crucial.
And we also need the patients' cooperation and support. Please do not insist on being in the high acute hospital, getting high-tech fast medicine. If the doctor advises you that you would be ok, go to the community hospital. It is more suitable, you get better and more appropriate treatment. We need everybody to cooperate so that we can deliver good, affordable healthcare and benefit all our patients. This is what the doctors and the hospitals can do.
But I think one important business in medicine, in healthcare is what we ourselves can do to stay healthy - by maintaining healthy lifestyles. I think you know what to do because every teacher tells children in school, and we tell you this all the time: eat more fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, do not smoke, keep your weight down. It is easy to say but very hard to do. I was reading one doctor lamenting how difficult it is to persuade people to lose weight in where they have a big problem. And she said, “I advise my patients to lose weight. Then my patients look at me. And I said: Yes, I know but please try”.
So please try. It is a change in attitude. You need lifestyle changes. It requires discipline, perseverance. So lectures and speeches would not work, necessary but would not be enough. The best way is to harness social links and interests to help individuals to stick to their good habits. So we have community programmes which combine fitness with fun, with social activities, brisk walking clubs, I think Northwest CDC has got a very popular activity going. Or qigong groups, this[picture]is one group, and all races participate.
One innovative scheme which encapsulates neatly what we need to do is the Wellness programme which Lim Boon Heng has been promoting and piloting in Jurong as well as a few other constituencies, with three components: Medical check-ups, regular exercise and social networking. So it becomes fun. And here[picture]you see the seniors are the ones who are dancing, not the ones who are looking. I think they are enjoying themselves. I went to visit the one in Jurong, and what really struck me was that all the seniors were cheerful and enjoying themselves, happy. So we will progressively expand this to cover the whole island. And we will reach out to more seniors so that we will help them to stay well and stay healthy.
Before I leave healthcare, let me just talk briefly about H1N1. That was at the beginning. It has been a big challenge for us these four months. I am very glad that Singaporeans have responded well to this unexpected virus. We were very worried when the news first broke in April of Swine Flu in . We knew it would reach us very soon but we knew very little else. How dangerous was it? How treatable was it? How badly would we be affected?
So at the onset we reacted strongly. We raised our alert status to orange. We did temperature scanning at entry points, masks and gowns in hospitals and clinics, home quarantine for suspects. And many people home quarantined themselves after they came back from overseas. Very soon it became clear that H1N1 was different from SARS - more contagious, fortunately less deadly. So we stepped down, orange to yellow, but we kept up our efforts to block the virus, to delay community spread, to buy time so we would not be overwhelmed by a huge spike of cases overnight.
The whole of Government responded. The whole of the population responded. We had learnt our lessons from SARS. And we succeeded in delaying community spread, and slowing the impact on us. Perhaps we were lucky but I think what we did made a difference. I would like to thank everyone who was involved in this - the doctors and nurses, the hospital staff and GPs, those taking temperatures at the entry points, teachers and principals in our schools and kindergartens, health officials and so many more. You worked under a lot of stress, there must have been some worry, concern over what the dangers might have been, but you did not shirk from your responsibilities, you continued to perform under pressure. There was even one case where neurosurgery had to be carried out and the surgeon carried out the neurosurgery fully garbed up in PPE -Personal Protective Equipment: gown, N95 mask and did brain surgery. I think owes this team and all of them a debt of gratitude.
This is how our healthcare system should work, not just against flu but all the time and for our long-term well-being. We have a good healthcare system, universally available and affordable to all. It is the envy of many countries. The Americans spend five or six times as much as us, their outcomes are worse, the British spend maybe double or three times what we do, their outcomes also not as good, and when they analyse their systems, they tell their people: the closest model to what they want to be is what Singapore is, with the 3Ms. So we have a good system, we must improve it but do not upset it and discard it because we are doing right and good by our people.
We will be ready for an ageing population. Each of us will also play our part to stay healthy and well and that is the way for Singaporeans to enjoy not just long life but good health and active golden years.
Critical to our long term success other than building the social safety nets like healthcare is maintaining our social cohesion and particularly looking after our racial and religious harmony. We have discussed potential fault lines in our society quite often, between the rich and the poor, between Singaporeans and new arrivals. You see letters in the newspapers all the time.
But the most visceral and dangerous fault line is race and religion. And people do not discuss that so much. So I asked myself why. And I think there are two possible reasons opposite to each other.
One is they may think we have no problem because we have been living peacefully and harmoniously for so long. But two, perhaps people know this is a very sensitive subject and they feel awkward to talk about it, to tread on sensitive ground, and they shy away from it. I think there is some truth in both explanations. Yes, we are in a good position but, yes, we are aware of the sensitivities.
Yet from time to time we have to discuss it, honestly but tactfully to assess the progress we have made, to recognise the trends in our society and the world around us and to remind ourselves to do better, and to tell ourselves where we need to do better. We have made a lot of progress over the last 40 years in building our harmony and cohesion. We have integrated our people. We have enabled all communities to move ahead. We have built a stronger sense of Singapore an identity and the religious groups have contributed a great deal to this progress.
The leaders of the groups have guided their flocks wisely. They have helped to set a wholesome and moral tone to our society. And they do a lot of good work, not just for their own flocks but for all groups. And they have respected and accommodated one another, made practical compromises so that all can live harmoniously together in a uniquely Singapore an way. I know it first-hand. I went to a Catholic school, it gave me a good education and now as an MP seeing cases, I know the good work which the church groups, the mosque groups, the temple groups do.
Recently, I saw a case. A man came to see me. He had a house problem. He said, “Please help me solve this problem. I have spent 23 years in jail, in and out. I have now turned over a new leaf. Please do not let me go back to where I was again.” And he showed me his proudest possession, a certificate of completion of a Bible study course which had helped him to turn over a new leaf and know what is right and good. So I tried my best to help him. I am not sure whether the problem will finally be solved but here was one man whose life had been changed vastly for the better.
We may take our harmony for granted in Singapore but our visitors are astonished. Recently I met the Grand Mufti of Syria. He came here to deliver the MUIS lecture and I spent some time with him. I learnt a lot from him. He told me that racial and religious diversity was a great treasure for a nation state. He was deeply impressed by how we had embraced diversity in Singapore . And he shared with me this parable.
He said, ""Imagine a mother with four children, a Christian, a Buddhist, a Muslim, a Jew. Which child should the mother love most?"" He said, ""It is an impossible question. Of course the mother will love all of them equally because they are all her children, but she will most approve of the one who takes best care of his or her other three siblings.""
So I replied to him, I said, ""Thank you very much for your compliment but I did not feel that Singapore had completely arrived and we still have to be careful because racial and religious conflicts can still pull us apart.""
Let me explain why this is so from a micro point of view and from a macro point of view. A couple of weeks ago, I saw a programme on TV, “Lonely Planet - Six Degrees” on Discovery channel. It was about Singapore and all the things you can do, food, entertainment and so on. And in one part of the programme, the presenter was going to watch a Malay band perform at a Malay wedding in a void deck. And the band leader was guiding the lady to the location.
On the way they saw some tentage put up. She said, “What is that? Is that the wedding?” The band leader, who was a Malay boy, said, “No, that is not the wedding. That is a Chinese funeral in the same void deck.” And he explained that a void deck can be used for weddings, funerals, also to play soccer. I think that last part is not quite right but he said you cannot watch pornography and other things. He added, “Malays, Chinese and Indians, we stay together in the same block, so when you have your cultural events, it all comes together.” And that is what usually happens in Singapore .
But sometimes, things go wrong like the case which I described in my Chinese speech just now. Two families both wanted the same place. The Malay family wanted to hold a wedding, Chinese family wanted to hold a wake, then there is a tussle.
In the incident which I described, fortunately the Malay family graciously agreed to move nearby to a different void deck even though they had the first claim after mediation by the grassroots leaders. And the MP and the Town Council facilitated this. They waived charges and they put up posters to inform the wedding guests to go to the right place. And so everything ended amicably. But it could easily have been otherwise.
I cite this example not to criticise one group or another but to point out that such sensitive incidents are bound to arise from time to time in Singapore . They are very rare, maybe one incident in 300 funerals. How do I know? We collect statistics on everything. It is about one every 300 funerals. Usually it is handled uneventfully by the Town Councils, sometimes the Malay wedding moves, sometimes the Chinese funeral moves.
This case was unusual because both parties stood firm at the beginning. Fortunately after mediation, one side decided to give way. But if such an incident had been wrongly handled and you have a case which escalates into a racial or a religious conflict, then one case is bad enough.
To solve such problems, to live peacefully together, we need good sense and tolerance on all sides and a willingness to give and take because otherwise whatever the rules, there will be no end of possible causes of friction, noise, auctions, seventh moon, parking because of the mosque or because of the church, joss sticks because the stray ashes will blow somewhere, dog hair. I was briefing our MPs on this case and this background recently and one MP said they had a case. A resident emailed him; a Malay resident. The upstairs neighbour had dog hair dropping on their clothes and he was very angry. I said I would be very angry too. I am not Malay but I would be upset too.
So cheek by jowl, there will be no end of episodes where we will rub against one another. And without tolerance and forbearance, we will have a problem. That is the micro point of view. You do not see it because we do not report a lot of it in the newspapers. We keep it quiet, we deal with it in a low key way. So you see the peaceful calm of Singapore harmoniously progressing. It is like a swan. You see it sailing across the water beautifully, gracefully, underneath paddling away furiously. That is what MPs are doing when you do not know what they are doing.
From a macro point of view at the same, if you look beyond Singapore and ask what our overall environment is like, I think that has some relevance to this question too. We see a global trend of rising religiosity all over the world. Groups have become organised and more active. Their followers have become more fervent in their faiths, stronger in their faiths. And it is true of all faiths and all over the world. Let me give you just a few examples which are relevant to us.
The United States is a strongly religious country. More than 90 per cent of Americans believe in God. By the surveys, more than 80 per cent consider religion important in their lives. And about 80 per cent are Christians. So it is a very strongly religious country and there is a wave of revival, with mega churches and tele-evangelism. They have enormous buildings where services are held and they have television channels. They have it all on the Internet. Their new media is much more advanced than my new media.
And US politics is strongly influenced by religion in the Republican and Democratic parties. With the Republicans, the Christian right is a powerful influence, setting the agenda, influencing who can be elected, what policies they pursue. The Democrats on the other side, they also need Christian support.
In the last presidential election, Barack Obama’s middle name became an issue. His middle name is Hussein but he is not a Muslim. He is a Christian. And he spent a long time trying to explain to people that “I am not a Muslim, I am a Christian and please vote for me.”
So religion and politics are supposed to be separated in America but in reality they are closely inter-tangled together. And there is a fierce struggle between the conservatives and the liberals in America over moral and cultural issues. They call them the Culture Wars. They argue over abortion, they argue over stem cell research, they argue over gay rights, gay marriages and so on. It is a fierce struggle with both sides striving to set the agenda, not just for their own followers but for the country.
With Muslims, there is an intense revival worldwide. It is also visible in Southeast Asia. There is a strong sense of ummah of the worldwide Muslim community, of all Muslims all around the world. You see it around us in Malaysia. In one generation - big change: rules on dress, on food, on alcohol, contact between men and women. Very strict rules prevail now which did not use to prevail a generation ago.
If you watch P Ramlee movies from the 1950s and 60s, the way they dress, the way they act, the way they perform, it was like an American sitcom but it was the society then — a different kind of Muslim society. Today you cannot imagine a P Ramlee movie being produced and shown over Malaysian television. It has become a conservative, more rigorously Islamic society among the Malays and Muslims. And Islam has become a major factor in Malaysian politics.
In Indonesia, there is a similar trend, not as advanced but similar. And the DPR, the parliament, is right now considering a law to require businesses to seek halal certification, not voluntary but compulsory. If you are doing business you must get a halal certification. Indonesia is based on Pancasila that means belief in one God regardless of which religion you belong to. And yet this is happening. In Indonesia, the society is changing.
They feel a sense of ummah too, of the global Muslim community. Recently there were the Xinjiang riots between the Uighurs and the Han Chinese. The Uighurs are Muslim, the Han Chinese are not Muslims, and the Indonesian Majlis Ulama Indonesia, or the Ulama Council, issued a statement in support of the Muslim Uighurs. It is not their struggle in Indonesia but they felt a sense of togetherness with the Muslims far away.
In South Korea, an East Asian country, was mostly Buddhists originally. But Christianity has become a major religion and the Christians have been successful in society. They have risen and they occupy important positions in business and in politics. The President is Christian. Mr Lee Myung-bak, he is a Presbyterian elder in his church. And some of his advisers are also Christian and the Buddhist community has raised concerns. Last year, thousands of Buddhist monks staged a protest against what they saw as Christians discriminating against Buddhists in Korea. The result was President Lee subsequently expressed regret that the Buddhists had been offended. The Buddhists have taken this positively, so there is some reconciliation and temperatures have come down.
These are things happening around us but Singapore is carried along by this global tide. On Fridays, mosques overflow, on Sundays, churches overflow, cinemas overflow, many halls over Singapore overflow with Christian services of all kinds. Buddhists too are active, reaching out to a younger, English speaking generation. And some have introduced music to spread their teachings. Hindus too are celebrating more religious festivals and events.
In itself, there is nothing wrong with people becoming more religious because religion is a positive force in human societies. It provides spiritual strength, guidance, solace, a sense of support for many people, especially in a fast changing and uncertain world. But at the same time, stronger religious fervour can have side-effects which have to be managed carefully, especially in a multiracial and multi-religious society. So what are these risks? Let me just highlight three of them.
Aggressive preaching or proselytisation. You push your own religion on others, and cause nuisance and offence. You have read in the papers recently, one couple who surreptitiously distributed Christian tracts which were offensive to other faiths, not just to non-Christians but even to Catholics because they said Catholics are not Christians. They were charged and sentenced to jail. But there are less extreme cases too which can cause problems.
For example, we hear from time to time complaints of groups trying to convert very ill patients in our hospitals who do not want to be converted and who do not want to have the private difficult moments in their lives intruded upon. But sometimes it happens. So aggressive preaching is one problem.
Intolerance is another problem. Not respecting the beliefs of others or not accommodating others who belong to different religions. You think of this as me versus somebody else, one group versus another group but sometimes it happens within the same family.
Sometimes, we have parents who have traditional religions, and children have converted away. Then when the parents die, and they had asked to be buried according to traditional rites, the children stay away from the funeral or the wake. It is very sad. From a traditional point of view, it is the ultimate unfilial act but it does happen occasionally. So intolerance, extremism, is another problem.
Exclusiveness is a third problem — segregating into separate exclusive circles, not integrating with other faiths. What does that mean? It means you mix with your own people. You do not mix with others. You end up as separate communities.
It could be a direct preference to stay among your own group, it could be indirectly or unintended but you prefer not to share meals with others or maybe you disapprove of yoga or taichi because you think there is something religious there. And instead of doing an activity jointly together, you end up with each group doing separate activities.
Yoga, for example, was an issue in Malaysia recently because there was a ruling that yoga was not halal and the Prime Minister then, Abdullah Badawi, had to come out and say yoga is okay as long as there is no chanting, or a religious component to it.
We foresaw these dangers 20 years ago. So we presented a white paper on maintenance of religious harmony in Parliament. We passed a bill, Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act in 1989-1990. Before we did that, the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the key ministers met all the religious leaders. We had a closed door session at MCYS. We spoke candidly. We explained our concerns, why we wanted to move this Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. The religious leaders spoke up candidly, and they gave us their support. We moved with their support. And we have continued to keep in close touch with them, to meet them regularly.
I do that personally — exchange views, discuss how to maintain harmony, keep the line warm and the confidence on both sides so I know you, you know me. If there is a problem, we are not dealing with strangers but with somebody we know and trust. And once or twice, I have had to meet them over specific difficult cases, not general discussion of religious harmony in Singapore but dealing with specific difficult issues. No publicity, but relying on mutual trust and the wisdom of our religious leaders to defuse tensions. And I am very grateful for their wisdom and for their support.
Because of this active work behind the scenes, we have not needed to invoke the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act for 20 years but it is something which is important to us which we must keep for a long time. We can never take our racial and religious harmony for granted. We will look after the issues but at the same time we must observe some basic principles to keep it the way it is. Let me tell you a few of these basic principles.
First, all groups have to exercise tolerance and restraint. Christians cannot expect this to be a Christian society, Muslims cannot expect this to be a Muslim society, ditto with the Buddhists, the Hindus and the other groups. Many faiths share this island. Each has different teachings, different practices. Rules which only apply to one group cannot become laws which are enforced on everyone. Muslims do not drink alcohol but alcohol is not banned. Ditto gambling which many religions disapprove of but gambling is not banned. If we have to live together in peace, then all have to adopt ‘live and let live’ as our principle.
Secondly, we have to keep religion separate from politics. Religion in Singapore cannot be the same as religion in America or religion in an Islamic country. Take Iran for example — an Islamic country, in fact, all Shi’ite. Recently, they had a presidential election which was fiercely contested and the outcome was disputed, between Ahmedinejad and Moussavi. Both sides invoked Islam in their support. Moussavi’s supporters had a battle cry — Allahu Akhbar (God is Great). But Iran is Islamic, it is Shi’ite. So after the battles, they can come back as one society.
In Singapore , if one group invokes religion this way, other groups are bound to say I also need powerful support and will also push back invoking their faith. One side insists I am doing God’s work. The other side says I am doing my God’s work. And both sides say I cannot compromise. These are absolute imperatives. The result will be a clash between different religious groups which will tear us apart. We take this very seriously.
The PAP ourselves remind our candidates when we field them: Bring your friends and supporters, but do not bring all the friends from your own religious groups. Do not mobilise your church or your temple or your mosque to campaign for you. Bring a multiracial, multi-religious group of supporters. And when you are elected, represent the interests of all your constituents, not just your religious group in Parliament. Speak for all your constituents.
Thirdly, the government has to remain secular. The government authority comes from the people. The laws are passed by Parliament elected by the people. They do not come from a sacred book. The government has to be neutral, fair. We are not against religion. We uphold sound moral values. We hold the ring so that all groups can practise their faiths freely without colliding with one another in Singapore . And that is the way Singapore has to be.
Let us rejoice in our harmony but let us never forget what being a Singaporean means. It is not just tolerating other groups but opening our hearts to all our fellow citizens.PM Lee Hsien Loong

You might ask: Does this mean that religious groups have no views and cannot have views on national issues? Or that religious individuals cannot participate in politics? Obviously not. Because religious groups are free to propagate their teachings on social and moral issues and they have done so on the IRs, on organ transplants, on 377A, homosexuality. And obviously many Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhist participate in politics.
In Parliament, we have people of all faiths and in Cabinet too. And when people who have a religion approach a national issue, they will often have views which are informed by their religious beliefs. It is natural because it is part of you, it is part of your individual, your personality. But you must accept that other groups may have different views, informed by different beliefs and you have to accept that and respect that. And the public debate cannot be on whose religion is right and whose religion is wrong. It has to be on secular rational considerations, public interests - what makes sense for Singapore .
The final requirement for us to live peacefully together is to maintain our common space that all Singaporeans share. It has to be neutral, secular. Because that is the only way all of us can feel at home in Singapore and at ease. And let me explain to you not based on arguments but specific examples to say what I mean. Sharing meals - we have different food requirements. Muslims need halal food, Hindus don’t eat beef, Buddhist sometimes are vegetarian. So if we must serve everybody food which is halal, no beef and vegetarian, I think we will have a problem. We will never eat meals together. So there will be halal food on one side, vegetarian food for those who need it, no beef for those who do not eat beef. Let us share a meal together, acknowledging that we are not the same. Do not discourage people from interacting. Do not make it difficult for us to be one people.
Our schools are another example where we have common space, and where all races and religions interact. In government schools, but even in mission schools. Even in church schools run by religious groups, there are clear rules which MOE has set so that students of all faiths will feel comfortable. You might ask: Why not allow mission schools to introduce prayers or Bible studies as compulsory parts of the school’s activity or as part of school assembly. Why not?
Why not let those who are not Christian or do not want a Christian environment go to a government school or go to a Buddhist school? Well, the reason why not is because if we do that, then we will have Christians in Christian schools, Buddhists in Buddhist schools, Muslims in schools with only Muslim children and so on. And I think that that is not good for Singapore .
Therefore, we have rules to keep all our schools secular and the religious groups understand and accept this. Take for example SJI. It is a St Joseph’s Catholics brother school, but it has many non-Catholic students including quite a number of Malay students who study there. And one year the Josephian of the year in 2003 was a Malay student, Salman Mohamed Khair. And he told Berita Harian that initially his family was somewhat worried about admitting him to a Catholic school and he himself was worried, afraid because he did not know what to expect but he still went because of SJI’s good record. He said “Now, I feel fortunate to be in SJI. Although I was educated in a Catholic environment, religion never became an issue”.
So indeed that is how it should work and I know it works because I understand that Malay students in SJI often attend Friday prayers at Ba’alwi Mosque nearby, still wearing their school uniforms. And SJI thinks it is fine, the mosque thinks it is find, the students think it is fine and I think it is fine too. That is the way it should be.
Another example of common space is in the workplace. The office environment should be one which all groups feel comfortable with. Staff have to be confident that they will get equal treatment even if they belong to a different faith from their managers, especially so of course in government departments but also in private sector. And I think it can be done because I think even religious community service organisations often have people who do not belong to that religion working comfortably and happily in that organisation. And this is one very important aspect of our meritocratic society.
Whatever other countries may do, this is what we have to do in Singapore . Maintain these principles: tolerance, keep religion separate from politics, keep a secular government, maintain our common space. The basis for this is practical reality in our society. It is not any abstract political theory. It is not any divine revelation. This is the only way all groups in Singapore can live in peace and harmony in Singapore .
So this is the background to the way the government looked at one recent issue, which I am sure you are waiting for me to talk about, which is Aware. We were not concerned who would control Aware because it is just one of so many NGOs in Singapore . On homosexuality policy or sexuality education in schools, there can be strong differences in view but the government’s position was quite clear. It was not at stake. But what worried us was that this was an attempt by a religiously motivated group who shared a strong religious fervour to enter civil space, take over an NGO it disapproved of and impose its agenda. And it was bound to provoke a push back from groups who held the opposite view which happened vociferously and stridently as a fierce battle.
The media coverage got caught up and I think the amplifier was turned up a bit high. People talk about mature civil society. This was hardly the way to conduct a mature discussion of a sensitive matter where views are deeply divided. But most critically of all, this risked a broader spill-over into relations between different religions.
I know many Singaporeans were worried about this, including many Christians. They may not have spoken out aloud but they raised one eyebrow and they kept their thoughts to themselves. Therefore, I am very grateful for the very responsible stand which was taken by the church leaders, the statement by the National Council of Churches of Singapore that it did not support churches getting involved and also the statement by the Catholic Archbishop, because had these statements not been made, we would have had a very serious problem.
The government stayed out of this but after it was over, after the dust had settled, I spoke to the religious leaders, first the Christians and then the religious leaders of all faiths including the Christians again so that everybody understood where we stood and what our concerns were, so that we can continue to work together to strengthen our racial and religious harmony.
This is an unusually serious and heavy subject for National Day Rally. Normally, you talk about babies, hongbaos, bonuses. No bonuses tonight, but a bonus lecture on a serious subject.
We discussed it in Cabinet at length and decided that I should talk about this. I crafted the points carefully, circulated them many times. Different presentations in Chinese, Malay, English because different groups have different concerns. But a consistent message so that there is no misunderstanding. And I also invited the religious leaders to come and spend the evening with us tonight and listen to the speech as well. It has a serious purpose, which I can explain face to face, so that you can help us to help your flocks to understand our limitations, to guide them to practise their faiths, taking into account the context of our society.
Please teach them accommodation which is what all faiths teach. And I look forward to all the religious groups continuing to do a lot of good work for Singapore for many years to come.
Finally on religion, let me share with you one story, a true story which was in an Indian newspaper recently, the Asian Age. It was picked up in the Straits Times. This was about a young from Gujarat, a Muslim who migrated to Singapore after Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002.
You may remember that there were very bad Hindu-Muslim riots. A train carrying Hindu pilgrims was stopped in Ahmedabad, and was set on fire. Circumstances were unclear, but 50 odd men, women and children burnt to death trapped in the trains. The Hindus rioted. They had no doubt what the cause was. And 1000 people died, mostly Muslims, because Ahmedabad has a large Muslim community.
This person was a Muslim who experienced that riot. And he decided to come to Singapore after the riot. We call him Mohamad Sheikh, it is not his real name because he still has family there. And he said, this is what happened:
“During the bloody riots, he watched three of his family members, including his father, getting butchered. His family had to pay for being Muslim. Besides losing his family and home, Mohamad lost confidence and faith in the civil society. He did not want to spend the rest of his life cursing his destiny. He wanted to move on.”
So seven years ago, Mohamad came to Singapore and got a diploma in hospitality management. Now, he is working at an eatery and he hopes to open his own business one day. He told his interviewer had he stayed in Gujarat, “I would have been hating all Hindus and baying for their blood, perhaps”. Now, “he loves it when his children bring home Hindu friends and share snacks”. And he told the interviewer proudly, “my children have Christian, Buddhist, Hindu friends.” And he even hopes to bring his mother to Singapore so that she can see for herself that “people of different races, different faiths can be friends and can co-exist peacefully.”
The interviewer asked him what Muslim sect he belongs to, which mosques he went to in India. He said, “I do not want to get into all that. Now, I am just a Singapore an and I am proud of it.”
This story reminds us that while we must not neglect to strengthen our harmonious society, we are in a good position. It is a Garden of Eden state. It is one where we are happy, where things are working and where if you leave the Garden of Eden, you cannot get back in again. So please stay there.
The Grand Mufti of Syria as well as many overseas visitors and diplomats have made the same point to us. It is what most impressed them when they watch our National Day Parade and National Day celebrations in the constituencies: Not the shows and the demonstrations and so on - they can see grander shows elsewhere - but the fact that in Singapore we live peacefully together, harmoniously.
And one of them said to me, you can have a minority Muslim representing a constituency of majority non-Muslim. Unimaginable in a country he came from. And he was a European. So let us rejoice in our harmony but let us never forget what being a Singaporean means. It is not just tolerating other groups but opening our hearts to all our fellow citizens.
If we stay cohesive, then we can overcome our economic challenges and continue to grow. We can strengthen our society safety nets. We can shape Singapore together. And this is how we have transformed Singapore over the last half century - solving problems together, growing together, improving our lives.
Words fail when you want to describe such an enormous change. So it is best to see the changes through pictures. I have gathered some - assembled from the archives, from the media who were very generous and from the Ministries and agencies. I also got a few from MediaCorp which ran a “Then and Now” contest, which lots of Singaporeans participated and gave some very nice pictures and stories which I hope to share with you. Let us see what has happened to Singapore over the last five decades.
We will start where it all began, with the Singapore River. This is[a picture of]what it looked like - lots of dirt. I am afraid I cannot bring the smell with me to show you. But my mother's office used to be near the Singapore River at Malacca Street. The street is still there. She used to have a blind telephone operator who came to work by bus every day. And the telephone operator told her that he always knew when to get off the bus because he could smell the Singapore River!
There were coolies on the Singapore River slogging away, carrying heavy loads, rubber, copra, rice from the tongkangs to the godowns and back, slogging for a better life for themselves, at the same time the basis of prosperity for Singapore 's entrepot.
Today this is all gone. The river has become transformed. The skyline has changed. No more tongkangs. We have got electric boats on the water. Boat Quay has no more coolies. You go there to enjoy yourself and have a drink, vibrantly. This[picture must be taken]early in the evening because everybody still looks sober! Coolies are also gone, but just to remind ourselves of where we came from, I suggested to STB and they built some bronze sculptures of the people who used to work there, so we can remember them.
Housing has completely changed. Singaporeans used to live in terrible living conditions. This[picture shows]Chinatown in the 1970s. People were desperately poor and families often squeezed into miserable little cubicles. This is not a double-decker bed. This is one cubicle below and another cubicle above, another family.
Mr Lim Kim San used to tell a story of how he went to visit these cubicles because he was chairman of HDB and he wanted to understand what the conditions were like. And he met a man living in one of these cubicles in Chinatown and he was seated in a bed covered with a blanket. And he said to the man, ”Is something the matter with you? Are you sick? It's so hot, why are you covered with a blanket?” And the man says, “No, I'm not sick, I'm doing this out of respect for you because my friend and I share one pair of trousers and he has gone to work wearing the trousers.”
So the PAP was quite determined to move people out of slums and to build public housing for all Singaporeans and one of the first projects it built was Tanjong Pagar Duxton Plain at Cantonment Road, to show the voters in Tanjong Pagar and in Singapore what the PAP government could do. And these buildings were coming up in 1963 during the elections,[this is a picture of]the opening in 1964 and you see pictures of MM visiting the houses such as MPs do now.
They were very pleased with those little flats. But it showed people what we could do and it helped to win Tanjong Pagar and the 1963 general election, without which Singapore 's history might have become different. Duxton Plain today has changed again. These blocks of flats have gone. Today we have the Pinnacle. This is a photograph, not a computer visualisation. The building will be ready by the end of the year, the tallest and I think the most valuable HDB flats in Singapore.
We went ahead to build entire new towns and among the earliest of our new towns was Toa Payoh. Originally just market gardens, some squatters, some villages, we cleared the vegetable farms and the kampongs and we put up a modern town taking shape, high-rise living, and we moved people into the high-rise flats.
And they brought with them their kampong spirit.So if you went to the flats, their doors were open, neighbours knew one another, they shared food, they chit-chatted, sometimes extended families on several floors in the same building. And here you see them friends with one another which this is good, but sometimes they also brought their kampong chickens upstairs.
HDB and the MPs worked hard to improve the estates, to raise the standards of social behaviour. We are still trying but we have made progress and with continuous upgrading, Toa Payoh now has a vibrant town centre with Toa Payoh Central and with MUP, SERS, IUP and all the other initials, the new housing blocks look quite good too.
So we have transformed Singapore physically. As the economy prospered our lives have improved. For the residents of the HDB flats, what is most important is not just what is outside the flat but what is inside their flat and the kitchen is the closest to people's heart.
So I have a very interesting pair of picturessent in by Mr Ivan Kang to ""Then and Now"". And he used to live in a kampong house in Jalan Sembawang Kechil. And here you can see him trying to light a fire in the traditional way. I think it must be a charcoal or wood fire and he has taken a new picture of his current HDB flat in Yishun. He looks as trim as ever.
Toilets tell an even more dramatic story. Used to be like this[picture].This is “Then and Now”. This is what is called ajamban. And the lady lived in a place like this till 1985. Fifty metres to the house, and inside that there is a tiny space, a hole in the ground and a bucket. Minister Yaacob tells me the last bucket in Singapore is now in a museum in MEWR. To bath, the families would just use an open area. So you see a little girl in the picture and she is standing in a pail and this is what the Cantonese used to calledpei dan gong. If you are old enough that means ""century egg jar"" which is what it was, came from China and we used to use this to bath. I used to use this too. Now, contrast this with a standard issue HDB toilet today, the toddler is not included.
To build a nation we not only house the people but also strengthen the ties with one another. So we built community centres all over Singapore . The early ones were very basic, just a simple building, zinc roof and inside you have a ping pong table, a community hall, maybe you can play carom or checkers. The star attraction was the black and white TV set with benches outside. Whole families and whole kampong gathered because people did not have TV sets. They came to watch. You do not need a lot of TV sets because at first there was only one channel, so we can all share the same channel.
Now, today's Community Centres (CC), sometimes you see them, you do not know what they are. I will not ask you but this is Marine Parade CC and if you go inside the CC, you can see people doing line dancing and wine tasting. There is the wine there and line dancing there and many other exciting things. It is quite different.
Our mosques have changed. Once upon a time, we hadsuraus— simple, primitive structure. Asurauis a little prayer house. This picture was provided by MUIS. MUIS told me this was at Jalan Angkap. I asked where is Jalan Angkap? MUIS said they did not know. So I checked up. Jalan Angkap is where there was once a gang fight and we think that it is somewhere in Kranji, but I think it is gone now.
Today with the Mosque Building Fund (MBF) we have new modern mosques and the most pretty one, I think, is the one I visited recently - the Singapore Islamic Hub and the Muhajirin Mosque, newly rebuilt. This is the Muhajirin Mosque. This is MUIS and behind that, there is Madrasah Irsyad., greatly admired by overseas visitors. Not just as places for prayers but also social centres for the community. So many things happened. This was Al-Iman Mosque at Bukit Panjang. I visited them last year. They had aRahmatan Lil Alaminevent, Blessings to All Day, so children dancing, they were doing blood pressure tests, doing blood donations and so on. A vibrant centre.
We have created opportunities for our people. In the past, young people had to find their own ways to amuse themselves. So when it flooded, there was a chance to take a swim. This is “Then and Now” and the picture was sent in by Ruhaya who is the girl on the right-hand side. Today our young people still swim but now they train in covered pools and they excel and win medals. This is the Asian Youth Games this year, we hope for a similar photograph at YOG next year. Please take note, national teams. And I hope many more young people will volunteer to become YOG volunteers next year and show the world what Singaporeans can do.
Our youth are already volunteering, fulfilling their ideals, venturing out, helping people all round the region. Here you see them in Chiang Rai in northern Thailand building a community hall. They are on the YEP, the Youth Expeditionary Programme.
So Singapore has changed. And what has enabled us to make this change and kept us safe and sound all these years is the SAF. We have prospered in peace, we have managed to maintain confidence in Singapore and we have deterred any potential aggressors. In the old days, we had the SAF but we depended on the soldiers and what they carry. And the firepower you could carry was a rifle. If you wanted more, you had the machine gun, if you wanted more, the biggest thing you could carry was the 120mm mortar. I used to be in the Artillery so I chose this picture.
Today, we have the 3G SAF and if you see the soldier, which you should not because he is wearing new camouflage uniform, he is just one soldier. Advanced Combat Man System and he is linked up and he should be able to call upon the firepower of the whole of the SAF. He should have a UAV somewhere to see what is happening. He should be able to have an F15 on call, if not enough, Apache helicopters. Not enough? You have a stealth frigate. Not easy to see because stealth. If still not enough then we will bring our big guns, the Leopard tanks.
And it is not just words. It is a network system all connected together, all integrated able to fight as one tri-service combined armed force. We have invested in the hardware. But the key is in the man or woman - his training, his courage, his commitment. The regulars and the NSmen have served the nation well and we are particularly grateful for the services of generations of NSmen who have sacrificed and endured considerable hardships and inconveniences for the country. From time to time we have a committee to recognise the contributions of Operationally Ready National Servicemen to Total Defence (RECORD). Very long name but it is the Record committee. And the Record committee has convened every few years and they have had good ideas on how we can recognise and reward NSmen.
For example, they have recommended us to build SAFRA clubhouses. And we have built a number. The most recent one is at Mt Faber. I chose this picturebecause behind every NSman there is a wife and children, and they carry maybe more half the burden of the NSman service. More than just ironing the uniform but also providing him moral support and encouragement to do his duty. RECORD V, chaired by Professor Koo Tsai Kee, has been meeting this year. The committee is completing its work finalising its recommendations. It should have some good news to announce soon. So we should look forward to the announcement within a couple of weeks.
We are continuing to renew our city, to build our future Singapore . Even in the middle of this recession we are working hard at it. And again it is not just the hardware but also the opportunities, the institutions, the heart-ware, the memories which we are creating, which is what makes Singapore tick.
As one united people, we can continue to upgrade and build this city and make this place our home, our future and our Singapore .PM Lee Hsien Loong

Let me give you an update on what is happening right now. We are delivering a first-class education system. We have made heavy investments in education at all levels, building new schools, equipping them with computers, labs and so on.
I will just show you 2 things which schools today which we never imagined. Media Production studios - so that even primary school children can make movies and productions and DVDs.
Indoor sports halls - big enough, roomy enough to play all kinds of activities. Hence you see all the different coloured markings on the ground because all games possible. Beyond the schools we are investing in our ITEs and polytechnics to provide a first class post-secondary education. This is ITE College East. It looks like a university. It is as good as a university in many other countries in the world. Republic Polytechnic in Woodlands, set in beautiful gracious grounds. Here they are doing some adventure training[picture].
But even beyond schools we want Singaporean to seek out and absorb knowledge because you must keep on learning and relearning. Therefore we are building modern libraries in our new towns. You may not have seen this one but this is in Bishan. And this is also a photograph, because it looks so perfectbut inside there are people and we can see them in a good environment. Somebody is browsing WiFi presumably, reading, chatting, finding a good spot to absorb information to keep up to date with the world, and maybe to chat with their boyfriends and girlfriends.
We are making a Singapore which is clean, efficient, reliable, safe. A train system which is clean, efficient, reliable, safe. If you go on MRTs in Singapore you can sit on any chair, no chewing gum. And it is safe, it is on time. We have opened 5 Circle Line stations. This is Serangoon station, just opened in May. But we are building a lot more because the Circle Line will be completed within the next couple of years.
These are the existing lines. We are going to have many more within the next few years and by 2020 we will have even more - Tuas Extension, Thomson Line, Eastern Region Line, North-South Line Extension - doubling the network which we have in Singapore . But you do not have to be underground all the time.
We need fresh air, green spaces, parks and gardens all over the island and that is what MEWR and NParks is doing. We have Park Connectors or this one at Telok Blangah along the southern ridges. The parks will be green, the waters will be blue. ABC Waters (Active, Beautiful and Clean). This is Kallang River which used to be the same standard as the Singapore River but now it is clean with the banks landscaped and beautiful. I know this because I walked there. The last time I was on leave I walked all along from Bishan down to Kallang and it does look like this. But the water itself, I think the public still needs to be a little bit cleaner. Do not drop so much rubbish in.
The city centre is becoming vibrant. I will show you one of the buildings. This is a real building. It is Orchard Central, colourful but the attraction is the road and the activities and the life along the street - buskers playing, people seeing and be seen, seen and being seen, all times of day and night. The centrepiece of our city is a new Marina Bay.
The last time I told you about it, it was a gleam in our artist's imaginations and impressions. Now we can see a new skyline taking shape. This is the existing buildings but if you go around the Bay, the Sail is here, NTUC Building is here with a “U”, the banking and financial centre is taking shape and if you turn round a bit more, this is what you would have seen — the IRs — already reaching the top and getting joined up[video].
I will show you how the Bay will look soon but rather than showing you more photographs, let me take you on a sail by and fly around starting on the Singapore River. Here we are going down the Singapore River, under Anderson Bridge and the Esplanade Bridge into the Bay. So you can see the IR and all round. And you fly out, the Grandstand, the floating platform, Singapore Flyer, coming out to the Marina Barrage down here. And next to that you have the Gardens by the Bay including the cool houses which will be interesting features. Trees, you see the instant trees have all arrived. And up to the top of the IRs where they have the Sky Park with a splendour view, I am getting dizzy looking at this. That is Art Science Museum and this is the Double Helix Bridge which you could have seen from the parade the other day. Along the bridge and you can take a view.
The IRs, you do not have to go in to gamble, you can enjoy yourself outside on the Event Plaza. They will have misters to keep you cool, fountains to amuse you, fountains there. And you go across the Bay and we will have here between the Business Financial Centre (BFC) and The Sail is a green lung with a promontory where you can have a party.
And some of these things are built. One-on-the-Bund is already in Clifford Pier, this is a floating restaurant, this is One Fullerton, the Merlion is still there, the Durian and you come back to the Promenade and you enjoy the sunset. (This video is) courtesy of URA.
From the Singapore River to Marina Bay, we have totally transformed Singapore over the last half century. 1959 was a moment of great change but nobody at the Padang in June 1959 imagined the change to today's Singapore . It was not possible. We will continue to improve our lives, provided we work together and remain a harmonious and a cohesive society so that in another 50 years, we will have built another Singapore which is equally unimaginable today. The key is to stay united through rain or shine.
We just celebrated a special National Day, not just at the floating platform but all over Singapore and in many other places too. And even on the Web where 100,000 Singaporeans left birthday wishes for the nation. There were many memorable moments.
Take the first National Education show last month. They projected a clip of me recounting at several rallies ago how it had rained on the 1968 parade but the participants marched on and we showed the world. They were tempting fate because as soon as they finished showing that clip, it rained on them. Poured, but even the rain could not dampen their spirit and the young participants stayed through the show, braved the storm together and said the Pledge, sopping wet.
The show on 9 August was impressive, but what was most impressive is not just the performance but what it takes to put on such a show and what the show says about the sort of nation we are. The imagination and creativity which had to go into conceiving the show, the ability to organise, to execute, to make it happen.
Many national servicemen spent a lot of time packing these bags and volunteers too and organising everything so you went there, everything was exactly what it was meant to be. The commitment to excellence in all that we do and the spirit of one people celebrating our nationhood together. All this was epitomised in the Pledge moment.
Singaporeans from all walks of life, all over the island, and overseas too, said the Pledge together at 8.22 pm. All united, one voice, saying what it means to be a Singapore an and as one united people, we can continue to upgrade and build this city and make this place our home, our future and our Singapore .
Good night.

   singaporewebsite update april",13080,"In his speech marking Singapore's 50th anniversary of self-government, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the nation's current economic challenges and outlined future developmental plans. Despite facing the most severe recession in decades, he expressed confidence in Singapore's ability to overcome these difficulties, drawing parallels to past challenges successfully navigated. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of both addressing immediate economic issues and planning for long-term sustainability.

Key areas of focus included the economy, healthcare, social harmony, and collaborative nation-building. He highlighted ongoing efforts to attract multinational corporations (MNCs) and promote high-end manufacturing and regional headquarters operations in Singapore. Notable developments included Rolls Royce establishing its global marine headquarters in Singapore and plans to manufacture aerospace components locally, creating skilled jobs and reinforcing Singapore's position as a reliable investment destination.

In healthcare, the government aims to adapt to an aging population by enhancing the ""3M"" system (Medisave, MediShield, Medifund) and developing infrastructure such as new hospitals and community-based step-down care facilities. This approach intends to provide sustainable, affordable healthcare and manage the increasing demand from older citizens.

Social harmony was stressed as critical for national success, with ongoing efforts to maintain racial and religious cohesion. The Prime Minister called for tolerance and the separation of religion from politics to ensure a secular, inclusive society.

Overall, the speech reaffirmed Singapore's commitment to strategic economic growth, robust healthcare systems, and social stability, setting a confident tone for overcoming present challenges and building a resilient future."
2010,"
Fellow Singaporeans, good evening.
Our economy has shaken off the recession and it is now booming. In the first half, our GDP grew by 18 per cent year on year, one-eight. Lots of jobs have been created, unemployment has gone down, Singaporeans can look forward to higher wages and good bonuses. Last year, Singaporeans were very worried about the future, but we have come through the crisis much better and much faster than we expected. Everyone contributed, the unions, the workers, employers and the Government as well did a little bit. So, thank you all for a job well done. While we have come through, we should not forget what has happened. We better learn some lessons from how we managed the downturn because despite all our preparations and precautions, sometime, somewhere, something will happen again and there will be future crises and we should be ready for them.
The NTUC attends the International Labour Organisation meeting in Geneva every year in June, ILO - many unionists have been - and this year, the ILO invited NTUC to share with the other delegates how Singapore coped with the downturn and rebounded so quickly and their presentation, talking about Jobs Credit, on the training programmes, on the resilience package and so on, generated a lot of interest. The delegates wanted to know, first, how did we pay for it without having to borrow money and secondly, how did we build the trust and confidence amongst all the key parties, the unions, the employers, the Government. In fact, these two questions point to the root of our advantage and competitiveness.
First of all, we built up reserves for a rainy day. So, when the rain came, we could fund our programmes, SPUR and so on, drawing on these reserves with the President’s permission, but without needing to borrow, unlike the Europeans, unlike the Americans, unlike the Japanese, all of which have run up huge deficits, continue to run big deficits and now face very serious problems. Secondly, we built up our trust over a long period through many shared trials and each time there was a crisis, we worked together and we became more confident in each other. Therefore in this crisis, the workers could accept the sacrifices which were necessary because they were confident that the employers would play their part and both sides were confident and trusted the Government to do the right thing and to take measures which would work. Together, the tripartite partners pulled Singapore through.
The NTUC is often asked to explain why and how Singapore works — the Singapore way — to other countries because other people can see how our system works. They want to understand it, they may be able to understand it, but then they want to be able to do it and that’s not so easy. NTUC once invited a delegation to Singapore from one of our neigbouring countries. We had some Singapore Inc projects there and we wanted to bring their unions onboard. We explained to them how we did it and at the end of the visit, the unionists told NTUC, ""the day my government behaves like the Singapore Government, that is the day my union will behave like the NTUC. So I think that will take some time.
For this year, our growth forecast is 13% to 15%. It is very, very good, but we cannot expect to grow like this for the long term. And also, if you see this growth in perspective over a longer timeframe, it is not quite so spectacular as all that. Let us just take three years, 2008, 2009, 2010. 2008, we were +1%, 2009 we were -1%, 2010, if we are lucky, +15%. +1, -1, +15 is +15. Divided by three to average it out, that means on average we have made over the last three years 5% growth. It is not bad, but it is not spectacular as what we thought and it is a realistic target of what we can sustain. So for the next ten years, if we can make 3% to 5% growth on average every year, I think we are doing well. Therefore, please be careful with wage expectations and have wage flexibility and bonuses, but remember tomorrow it may rain again.
We have to keep growing to generate resources to upgrade our city and improve our lives and to enable each Singaporean to have a secure job, afford a good standard of living and get a good future for his children. Therefore, we need to raise productivity. That is not just a matter for workers working harder. In fact, it is not a matter of working harder, it is working smarter. But workers have to make the effort, employers have to make the effort and the Government also must be productive.
Let me give you some examples of what I mean by productivity. First at the worker level, it means upgrading knowledge, skills, doing wider range of jobs, becoming more valuable to your firms. I give you one concrete example — Mr Tong Shiang Wee, who is working for a company called Cameron, which makes equipment for the oil and gas industry. He is now in his late 40s. He joined the firm when he was 21 years old with no school qualifications, started at the bottom as a trainee fitter, because it is an oil and gas company, so you are working with oil field equipment. But his attitude was ""must try, no harm trying"". Over the years, he kept learning on the job, attended courses to upgrade himself and today, his job title is Manufacturing Specialist and he oversees 70 technicians and four production supervisors. And that is what job upgrading and job enlargement means, from doing your own work to being able to watch over many other people’s work and making sure that many other people are productive, too.
Secondly, employers also play a key role because for the worker to be productive. The employer must create the right business environment, must find the right business opportunities and then they can develop expertise in this business, create value and grow a competitive and profitable business which can hire productive workers. I give you one example, our shipyards, Keppel and SembCorp Marine. They have developed deep specialist knowledge and skills in their business, which is to make jack-up oil drilling platforms. Two of them are the market leaders in the world and together, they produce 70% of all the jack-up oil rigs in the world. These are oil rigs which go and drill for oil in very deep waters.
Recently, you might have read of a major oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Deepwater Horizon, owned by BP, exploded, sank, caused a major disaster in the sea and all along the Gulf Coast. Millions of barrels of oil were spilled. I was in Houston recently, which is near where the spill happened, and I met a Keppel executive there. He was overseeing their plant in Texas at Brownsville. So I asked him - Did we build that oil rig which exploded? He said, ""No, but we built the rig from which they are mounting their rescue operations"". That is a very interesting story and let me try and explain to you. (This is not a class, but just trying to make myself clear.) Deepwater Horizon used to be here, drilling for oil here, 18,000 feet below the surface of the sea. It exploded, it was a mishap, sank, oil poured out. The platform from which they were mounting rescue operations, sending in submersibles, trying to close it off and doing all the complicated things, Q4000, was made by Keppel. But there are two other platforms in this picture. They are drilling two relief wells from here and from here to try and join up with the bore hole deep under the sea so as to do a ""bottom kill"" to seal it off with concrete. You imagine you have got to go all the way down and drill through 18,000 feet and find this right spot and join up just there.
Why am I explaining this to you? Because this one is built by Keppel and this one is built by SembCorp. Let me show you, Q4000, this is the rescue platform and in the background, you can see DDIII, which is also the Keppel one, it is called Development Driller III, and on the other side, you can see the DDII, the white one. Not bad for a country which has no oil. But we are there and therefore the two companies pay good bonuses in good years. I hear a rumour that last year, they got nine months and we get something too because several hundred million dollars of taxes to the Government. That is productivity.
My third example of productivity you may not expect, though many of you will be familiar with it. It is from the public sector because the Government also must do the right thing and make sure that it spends money wisely, it spends time wisely, it uses its resources well and gets results. It is harder to measure government outcomes because it is not always in dollars and cents, but it is still important for us to seek out efficiency gains and to do the best we can. I give you an example which all the men here should know about — IPPT for NSmen. It used to be a very manual process — PTIs, stopwatches, clipboards, pieces of paper, queuing up, waiting, hurry up and wait. But now it is a highly automated process. If you go to one of these IPPT centres and you do your chin-ups or sit-ups, they have got sensors to count the number of chin-ups and sit-ups you complete. So you do not have to argue with the PTI. Then when you run 2.4 km, you carry an RFID in your number tag. It is like what you do when you run a marathon and automatically your time is logged. When you cross the finish line, they know. You get good service too because with this RFID, the NSmen can go and check their scores and their status at the computer. There you are, he has got his number, the ID is inside here and he can see his results any time. Result - save manpower. Result - NSmen’s time saved and result - also a sense of purpose and efficiency because then the NSmen can feel that I am going there, I am achieving something, I have done it, I am off, no slacking around, no standing around and waiting. That is what all government departments must learn to do.
Productivity has to be the responsibility of all of us, to keep learning and upgrading, to increase our value and contribution and that is the way Singapore can stay ahead of the competition. Our firms can do well and all of us can improve our lives.
This year, with the booming economy, we will definitely need more foreign workers so that we can create more jobs in Singapore. A few months ago, I mentioned to the press that we could need more than 100,000 foreign workers more this year. There was a big ooh which you could almost hear. Well, since then, we have recalculated. Maybe, we will get by with a few less, perhaps 80,000 workers. But I said this to highlight the trade-off which we face and which we cannot avoid. You want higher growth which will benefit our workers, that also means accepting more foreign workers to come and work in Singapore. You choke off the foreign workers, the economy is stifled, growth is not there, our workers will suffer.
This is a very hot topic in Singapore, foreign workers and also immigration and we have held many dialogue sessions with the grassroots, with the residents and I think that Singaporeans understand logically, if you argue it out with them - why we need foreign workers, why we need this immigration. But they are still concerned about competition for jobs, about crowding, competing for houses or for transport on MRT and deeper things, like the character of our society. And, of course, there is the psychological aspect too, the sense that they want to be valued, make sure that Singaporeans are more valued than foreigners. These concerns come through many other channels as well. We talk to the union leaders, they will reflect some of them. You read in the newspapers’ columns, the letters which are written, sometimes this shows up. When we build workers’ dormitories, we have to be very careful. We remember the sensitivities which can be aroused. Serangoon Gardens two years ago got very upset because things were not explained well enough. I understand these sentiments because these are legitimate concerns which we take seriously. We do not brush them aside, but we have to weigh them against the plus side of having the foreign workers and immigrants - why it is necessary for us to let in a controlled inflow so that we can derive benefits from it. Tonight I cannot solve the whole problem, I cannot explain all aspects of this problem, but I will try and explain why staying open is going to benefit us - meaning all Singaporeans - and when there are problems, what we can do to address these problems.
We are not the only country grappling with this issue where citizens are queasy about foreign workers and immigration. There are many countries which host significant foreign or immigrant populations. People are coming into contact, mingling, who did not use to mingle. There are frictions, insecurity and political pressures which build up. So the issue has become hot in many countries, even in Japan which has very few foreigners, in Australia, in Britain, in France, in Germany, Netherlands, even Switzerland, even the US.
The US is one of the most open societies in the world. They build themselves on immigrants, but Americans have also grown uncomfortable with the influx and especially of illegal immigrants, people who are there informally, working, no papers, but if they all leave, America is in trouble.
In Houston, in Texas where I was, the greater metropolitan area has five million population, about the size of Singapore, and many immigrants which contribute to a vibrant city. They have about a quarter-million Chinese immigrants, maybe the same number of Indian immigrants, and Latins. It is a lively city and at the leading edge for medicine and research. The Texas Medical Centre is one of the largest centres which is doing research and advanced treatment in the world, cancer, R&D, all sorts of things, 49 hospitals, universities, research centres, all clustered around Houston, full of foreign researchers. In every lab, one of the researchers told me, somewhere you will find somebody from the PRC and I am sure there will be somebody from India and others too. But they are there, they are making it happen.
I met business and city leaders in Houston and they said that the Texas political leaders had shown courage, keeping the state open to immigrants and whenever neighbouring states like California or Arizona clamped down and tightened up, pushed out the immigrants, Texas would collect some of the good ones and would benefit. It does not mean that Texas does not face problems because of this, but overall, because they have stayed open, it has been a plus for them and they hope that Texas would continue to stay open.
I also met Bill Gates of Microsoft on the trip. Microsoft is an IT company, you will know about it, the kind of business which we want to be as Singapore, knowledge - intensive, innovation-intensive, depending on talent and looking to the future. I asked Bill Gates, where do you do your research? And he told me, I will show you the map. I will just show you the dots and if you study the map, you will find very interesting where they have gone to do research. They have research centres in America because Microsoft is an American company. They have research centres elsewhere in the world because you have to tap talent everywhere. Where are they in America? Redmond, Washington state, up in the northwest. Why? Because the Microsoft headquarters is there and it is a good place to live. Where else are they? Down in Silicon Valley where the brainpower is, lots of IT talent, lots of Indians and Chinese and others, they have gone tracing them. They are in Cambridge in New England. That is where Harvard and MIT and other universities are, like Princeton.
Overseas, where are they? Cambridge, England, because of the University of Cambridge. Bangalore, India, because of the IT companies and the Indian IT talent. And we are there too, JTC has built a techpark for the IT business here in Bangalore. And in Beijing, because they have got Tsinghua, they have got Beijing Daxue and they have all the talent from China in Beijing. So they go where the talent is, but there is one more interesting point about this slide. If you zoom in carefully on Redmond, you will find that it is two spots. One, on the American side of the border in Redmond, the other one on the Canadian side of the border in Vancouver. Why are they in Vancouver? Because the Americans restrict visas for professionals. So, when Microsoft wants to bring in IT talent to Redmond, they cannot get enough H1B Visas, which is what professionals need to work in America. So, instead, they go to Canada because Canada welcomes these skilled workers with open arms, and if the person has a C$100,000 job offer, which is about US$100,000, then practically stapled to that job offer is an offer of a Canadian Green Card. So because of the difference in policies, America has lost out, Canada has gained.
Bill Gates told me that globally, one-third of the researchers are Chinese in Microsoft, one-third of the researchers are Indian. Recently, he attended a presentation of awards to 12 top Microsoft employees, those who had the top confidential report staff assessment rankings. Out of the 12 names, he could only pronounce one - Chris Jones - without help. All the others were foreign-born and many of them were Asian. So, what is the lesson for us? That immigration and foreign talent are difficult issues everywhere. They pose very real political problems and social problems, but if we can manage these political and social challenges, then the benefits to us are substantial.
Let me sketch you briefly why it is important for us to stay open. First, because we need talent, we need to gain talent. It makes a tremendous difference to us doing critical work in our economy, helping Singapore to become an outstanding city. We have very good people, but never enough and, therefore, we need to draw from all over the world to supplement our local pool. You take professionals, for example, architects. There are lots of talented young architects in Singapore. Recently, URA held an exhibition, ""20 Under 45"", and they published a little book showcasing the outstanding works by 20 young architects below 45-years-old. The majority of the architects are native Singaporeans although quite a few are foreign-born and the foreign-born ones include the two architects who built the Pinnacle, a husband and wife team. The husband, Mr Khoo Peng Beng, is from Ipoh, now a PR. The wife, Belinda Huang, is from Selangor, now a Singapore citizen. They won a design competition to build on the Duxton Plains site and the result is one of the most sought-after HDB projects in Singapore. In fact, we do not have enough Pinnacles and so many voters and residents want us to build some more. For the local architect, you might consider this foreign competition, too fierce, unfair, but for Singaporeans and especially for the residents of the Pinnacle, we benefit, we get a better living environment, we get a more beautiful city. And I think even our own architects benefit because from the competition, from that stimulus, we will do better and we will produce better works too.
Take sports talent as another example. We are grooming our own. Our young sportsmen have done very well in the YOG, the young Olympians, and in some sports we are near the top in the world rankings like sailing or bowling. This is Jasmine who is the women’s champion two years ago and last year was our Sportswoman of the Year. But in other sports, we still need to draw on new citizens, like table tennis. We are very proud of Isabelle who won a Silver medal in the YOG. But we have too few Isabelles and so we have topped up and our women's team has done very well. They won the Silver at the Beijing Olympics. Here, you see them receiving their medals. In Moscow, at the World Team Table Tennis Championships, they beat China to win the Gold medal and here you see Feng Tianwei celebrating. Our team players may not have been born here. I do not think they speak good Singlish, but they have chosen this place to be their home. They are playing for Singapore, flying the flag for Singapore and when they win the band plays Majulah Singapura. So, we should cheer for them, just as we cheer for all of our national sportsmen. So that is the first reason for talking about, for needing this, talent is critical to us.
The second reason is we need reinforcements to grow our economy and create better jobs for Singaporeans. The foreign workers supplement our ranks and enable us to build successful companies. You take Keppel and SembCorp again. They are world-beaters. Together, they employ 20,000 people in Singapore of whom 5,000 are Singaporeans. The other 15,000 are foreign workers, professionals. Without the foreign workers, the Singaporean jobs would not exist. Of course, the converse is true too. Without the Singaporean brains working the system and bringing the foreign workers together and organising them, the foreign worker jobs would not exist either. So they are complementary to each other. The shipyards employ foreign workers and professionals from many countries all over the world. You just take a look at some of the flags where the countries are. Asia, you would not be surprised, Europe you would not be surprised, but also Russia, South Africa, Brazil, Chile. Because they come from all over the world, they bring a wide range of skills and experiences, knowledge about different countries, different markets and, therefore Keppel and SembCorp have become world-beaters and it is good for us.
The final reason we need immigrants is to make up for our shortfall in babies. Our efforts to produce more Singaporean babies have not yielded results, not yet. Two years ago, I made a long speech in the NDR about new measures. Last year, we produced fewer babies than in 2008. For this type of productivity, please work harder.
But I think we should make an important distinction between foreign workers and immigrants, immigrants meaning PRs and citizens. Foreign workers are transient. We need them to work in the factories, in the banks, hospitals, shipyards, construction projects. When the job is done, they will leave. When there are no jobs here, they will go. So temporarily, the economy is hot, I think we can accept higher numbers. For the longer term, we are pushing to raise productivity so that we can rely less on foreign workers. But meanwhile, we want to build flats, MRT lines, IRs. So, please bear with the larger numbers for the time being.
That's foreign workers. Immigrants, the PRs and the citizens are far fewer. We are very careful whom we accept. Not only must they contribute to our economy but they have also got to integrate with our society and strike roots here. We have moved quite fast over the last five years. We have accepted a larger inflow of foreign workers and we have taken in more new citizens and PRs. Conditions were good, we caught the wind, we moved forward. But now I think we should consolidate, slow down the pace. We cannot continue going like this and increasing our population 100,000, 150,000 a year indefinitely and we should give Singaporeans time to adjust and our society time to settle and integrate better the newer arrivals. But we must not close ourselves up. The basic principle for us is always citizens come first and that is how our policies are designed – citizens before PRs, PRs before other foreigners and non-residents. Last year, we reviewed the policies, we changed the subsidies to make this distinction sharper. So, education fees, healthcare subsidies, housing subsidies, all adjusted so that it is quite clear that the Singaporeans get the best deal. But not everything is reduced to subsidies and dollars. There are other less tangible issues too which I will also talk about, not to dismiss them, but then explain how we can manage the problems and enjoy the benefits of the inflow by limiting the downside.
First of all, competition from foreigners. I think many Singaporeans accept the economic logic that the economy needs these foreigners, but they fear the impact on them. What if the foreigner takes my job? What if my own wages get pushed down? I understand this, I empathise, and in fact, we take measures to help to protect Singaporeans. For example, as I explained in Chinese just now, we do not allow the foreigners to come in uncontrolled because otherwise we will be swamped. We restrict the foreign workers through dependency ratios, through the foreign worker levies so that when you hire a foreigner, the employer pays an extra foreign worker levy to discourage him from hiring a foreigner and look for a Singaporean instead. The levies are going up, they are going to go up further and I think they have to go up further beyond that in the longer term or maybe in the not-so-long term. I think some employers may feel the pinch, but it is necessary because we need to manage the inflow and not have an indefinite number.
On the other side, we have Workfare which helps low-income Singaporeans so that when they work, they get a top-up to their wage from the Government and that makes it more worth their while to work and improves what they receive and overall they end up better off compared to the foreigner who gets no Workfare. This year we are going to spend $400 million on Workfare, giving it to 400,000 Singaporeans. That is a lot of money and I think it is a lot of help to our lower-income group. But the protection can only go so far. If you lack the skills or you are not competitive, then it does not matter how high the foreign worker levy is, or how generous the Workfare is, the jobs are still going to go elsewhere. Just like Vancouver could take jobs from Redmond, so too many countries can take jobs from Singapore and we have to understand that.
I have discussed this question with the union leaders regularly and they understand the logic. They were more worried a few years ago when the flows were growing and they were not sure of the impact on Singapore workers. But now, their members are quite convinced that their companies benefit from being able to hire foreign workers and the union leaders say, yes, it is not an issue with my workers because they understand that the foreigners and the Singaporeans complement each other. And at the firm level, within each of the companies, the foreigners and the Singaporean workers work well together. They gave me this rather nice example of workers in one hotel at the housekeeping department, with employees, both locals and foreign workers. The locals are the “aunties”, the more experienced ones and the foreign workers are the younger ones. And the ""aunties"" treat the foreign workers like their own daughters or nieces. When they arrive in Singapore, they help to orientate them, even help them to cook or unpack or pack their food for them and the heavier, physical tasks, like turning over mattresses, younger foreign workers will be able to do and between the two, they have worked out a good working relationship and become firm friends, so much so that when one of the foreign workers applied for PR, the supervisor and the union rep both asked the management to assist in the PR application. I am not sure whether she succeeded, but it shows that the unions and the employers and the workers are getting on well, which I think is very important.
The second worry of Singaporeans is whether the new arrivals will integrate into our society. Will they identify with Singapore? Will they grow roots here? After all, they speak and dress differently, their social norms are different and they may speak no English or very little English. So it is harder to fit in and communicate, particularly with the non-Chinese. We encourage the immigrants to learn English. Our community centres will offer basic English courses and I think if they will come and pick up a few words, this proficiency will help them to integrate and therefore become more ready for permanent residence or citizenship later on should they apply for it. But more important, beyond language or social graces, the immigrants have to get along with the different communities here, different races here and adopt our egalitarian norms. This is a multiracial society. Our Chinese are used to getting along with Malays and Indians. Our Indians are used to getting along with Malays and with Chinese. The immigrant Chinese who come, the immigrant Indians who come may not be used to this and it takes some time for them to adjust, but they should make the effort.
Some of them have gotten along fine. We have foreign workers now working as bus drivers in SBS. I asked the CEO, how does it get along? And he said, well, it is not bad. Sometimes, they get flak, but sometimes it works out very well. He gave me an example of Ms Zhao Xiaodong who comes from Dalian and she is the bus captain of Service 109 from Serangoon Interchange to Changi Village, going through Pasir Ris and she is well-liked by her passengers, especially the Pasir Ris residents. At one point, she had to go away for a week. Several of the commuters wrote to SBS: they said, what has happened to our bus driver? She is polite, she is caring, she is considerate to pregnant women and the elderly. Have you transferred her to another route or maybe she has left SBS? Whatever it is, please bring her back to Service 109, which I think is where she still is. So I think at the personal level, if you can get on and the relationships can be established, that is a tremendous help.
Singaporeans, too, should do their part to understand and integrate in the new arrivals. We do many of these activities. Some of them are more serious activities, like bringing the immigrants here. They are at the Army Museum. This is the People’s Association doing National Education, preparing the new generation of NSmen and anxious parents behind. But some of these activities are more lighthearted, for example, this one. This is ""Singapore Shiok"". It is a handbook produced by SMU, done by the students, in order to guide international students coming to Singapore and this young man is an international student studying hard in Singapore and the handbook tells them how to get along, what are all the acronyms we use, all the Singlish we use and where the favourite eating places can be so that they can settle in and become Singaporean. But individuals should also help new arrivals to ease into the community because the key to this is not just your arguments and the principles and the logic but the personal ties and the friendships.
On the immigrant side, I think it is very helpful if the new citizens and the PRS can also make the effort to engage Singaporeans and to give back to Singapore society and some of them are doing this. For example, in SINDA, there is Project Read which is a programme where volunteers ""adopt"" kids from disadvantaged homes and spend time with the kids, reading to them, mentoring them, helping them to make progress and it has benefited over 4,000 kids. The volunteers, half of them almost, are PRs and new citizens, including this one, who is Mrs Mazumdar from India who is now a Singapore citizen. So I think both sides have to make the effort. Growing roots takes time. You cannot plant an instant tree and tomorrow expect it to have taken root. It takes time, but gradually, the new arrivals will connect, identify with Singapore and finally we hope some will make the decision to commit themselves and become Singapore citizens. Now, for one new citizen family, the defining moment was when their daughters started to think of India as a place to go for holidays and Singapore as home and then loyalties shifted.
The third issue which Singaporeans worry about, and legitimately, is NS, tied up with loyalty and commitment. National Service is a heavy demand on male residents and I should say on their spouses and families, too. Two years full-time, then more years as ORNS men while all the time trying to build a career and raise a family. Unfortunately, it is not practical for us to make all the foreigners come to do NS. Firstly, you will not get the foreigners; secondly, it will be Dad’s Army and I would not like to be their platoon commander. But their children will serve and many PRs who came here as children, many first-generation citizens, have done NS. But even then, there is still the sense amongst Singaporeans that citizens are carrying a heavy burden. So, therefore, we do all that we can to recognise the contributions and the sacrifices of our NSmen. We have had Record committees, one after another. Each time, we have got new ideas, we have implemented them, SAFRA clubhouses. We have got allowances from the Government, we have got tax reliefs, we have got top-ups when we have growth-pegged bonuses and packages and so on.
Tonight, I would like to propose a new initiative, the National Service Recognition Award. What will it do? Two things. First, help with the cost of the subsequent education of NSmen and secondly, also to help them to buy a house. What is this going to be? A meaningful sum, in total, S$9,000 for soldiers, a little bit more for commanders, and we will pay this in tranches at major milestones of the NSman’s service. It will go into his Post-Secondary Education Account, it will go into his CPF account and it is a significant tangible recognition of the sacrifices and the efforts and the contributions of our National Servicemen. It is for citizens only. The PRs who do National Service, when they take citizenship later, they can get it too. I think this will be a significant token of appreciation and I do not want to go into all the details tonight. MINDEF will announce the details very soon. I hope it will be well-received.
Finally, there is an issue of crowding and congestion, too many people in Singapore, there is not enough space, solitude. Will we have enough facilities for Singaporeans and foreigners? Where these are practical concerns, we can also do something about them. School places, I talked about in the Chinese speech just now, we will ensure enough school and university places and we will upgrade our system so that everybody gets a good education, which I will talk about later on.
Transport is another area where people worry about congestion, especially on the trains. We know there is an issue here. LTA and the transport operators have been working on this problem. We have been discussing it with them and let me try and explain what the problem is, where the problem is and what we can do about it.
Here is a map of our MRT System. Most of the time it is working fine, the peak hours are when the crowding takes place. Peak hours morning and evening, but morning more than evening, particularly between 7.45 and 8.45 am. And the yellow, orange and red parts show you where the crowding is the most severe. The green parts are generally okay. So where is it? It is on this North-South Line coming down from Bukit Gombak to Dover and particularly here, around Jurong East, which is very, very crowded. It is along the North-East Line from Serangoon Gardens down to Dhoby Ghaut, which is crowded coming in-bound and it is along the North-South Line, coming down from Nee Soon, but particularly, this little segment between Toa Payoh and Novena. Those are where the most serious difficulties are and those are where we are doing things about it.
First for this segment, from Bukit Gombak to Dover, we are modifying the Jurong East Station, the work will be done by May next year. We are getting new trains. With the new trains and the new station, we will be able to run more services during peak period. I think that will help a great deal. Along the North-East Line, from next year, we will run an extra train during the peak period in the morning and that means shorter intervals, less waiting for passengers. We are also buying new trains for the North-East Line, they will take five or six years to come, but the process has started and when they come, we can increase the capacity for the North-East Line and we will be able to carry 50 per cent more passengers, which is plenty.
The North-South Line — the congestion is not as severe, but we expect the traffic to grow because the population in the north will grow and we must anticipate that. With the Circle Line partially complete, we have already taken some of the load off the North-South Line and next year, the Circle Line Phase 3 will be completed and I think that will help some more. Beyond that, we are changing the signalling system on the North-South Line and also the East-West Line so that we can run trains at shorter intervals. Instead of 120 seconds, which is two minutes, you run it at 100 seconds and that means we can run 20% more trains. It will take some years to do because the trains are running all the time and we only have three or four hours every night to do this. So, please be patient, but the work is under way.
We are investing enormously in our rail network. In fact, over the next decade, we are going to spend S$60 billion and we are going to double the rail network, from what we have now to another three major lines coming along. First, the Downtown Line, which comes down from Bukit Timah and also from the East Coast. Secondly, the Thomson Line, which comes down from Sembawang and will ease the pressure on the North-South Line and thirdly, the Eastern Region Line which will go through Marine Parade and come down to town and ease the pressure on the East-West Line. The plans are there, we are going to build it. We have not settled all of the train stations yet, so do not buy your houses yet. But we are doing everything possible to improve matters. I hope Singaporeans will understand. Be patient. LTA has a very difficult job. SBS Transit and SMRT also have a very difficult job. The trains will always be packed during peak hours. It happens everywhere. In other cities, in fact, the crowding is even more severe, but we are trying not to get to as bad as the other cities. Please be patient. We cannot guarantee that every passenger can get onto the first train every time or even that he can get onto the second train every time. But there will be trains every couple of minutes and if you miss one, the next one will be just a few minutes away.
Another area where people worry about the impact of foreigners is housing. Especially this year with house prices going up sharply, people are very concerned and some Singaporeans blame it on foreigners. I have no doubt that when immigrants come and work-permit holders come, it contributes to housing demand because they must live somewhere and houses have to be built for them which we will do. But there are also other broader economic forces at work because if you look back over the last two years the number of people in Singapore have been more or less the same throughout, but two years ago, property prices were falling and they were falling last year until the middle of the year when suddenly, the mood changed and the property prices started shooting up again. And it is happening not just in Singapore; it is also happening in Hong Kong and in other cities around the region, in China and, therefore, there are other broader factors at work. But whatever it is, it is something which we are focusing our minds on.
We will manage immigration to make sure Singapore does not become too crowded and we can commit to you, I promise you, we will always keep HDB flats within reach of Singaporeans. That is what HDB’s mission is, that is why it exists. The flats will be affordable, the supply will be adequate. You cannot get it straightaway tomorrow, but the wait will not be too long. HDB will build more flats. This year, we built 16,000 new flats. Next year, HDB will build up to 22,000 new flats. So if you miss one BTO, do not worry, the next one is coming. Within a month, there will be another BTO and you will be able to get one before too long. There are 22,000 new flats coming along and we do not have 22,000 new couples getting married in Singapore every year.
Secondly, HDB will try their best to speed up the completion of these BTO flats. It takes about three years, sometimes three-and-a-half years, from the time when you book to the time when you collect your keys. HDB thinks they can bring it down a little bit. Mah Bow Tan says, do not promise, but we will try our best and I think everybody expects them to deliver their best. Thirdly, we will emphasise home ownership. We have loosened up on rules for private property owners to buy HDB resale flats over the years. I think there are quite a number of private property owners who buy HDB resale flats and then they resell them within quite a short period of time because they are allowed to within one year or two years. We have raised the period a little bit, but I think we should tighten up on rules further so that it is quite clear that HDB flats are meant primarily for owner occupation.
That takes care of the vast majority of the population, 80%, all those who earn less than S$8,000 family income and are eligible for HDB flats. But there is a sandwiched group, those who are earning a bit more than S$8,000 but who cannot quite afford private property. We have the Executive Condos and those between S$8,000 and S$10,000 family income can presently buy Executive Condos which they will get a housing grant - S$30,000, and they arrange their own financing. But I think this group is quite anxious about falling in-between, since they are not eligible for HDB and they cannot afford private property. They are anxious and I think their parents are also very anxious because the parents say I will have to help to fork out for my kids. And because people are marrying a little bit later, so their incomes tend to be a little bit higher. So they worry that they will get promoted before they get settled. We will do more to help them own their homes. We will widen the choice which is open to this group between S$8,000 and S$10,000, beyond executive condos to allow them to buy HDB DBSS flats, Design, Build and Sell Scheme, which are quite many because every year, we have a few thousand DBSS flats, as many as we have Executive Condo flats on sale. They can buy DBSS, same terms like the Executive Condos, S$30,000 grant, arrange your own loan. And we will release more lands, so that we will build more ECs, more DBSS and there will be enough supply for this group of Singaporeans as well.
The third part of the property market is the private property market. We have twice acted to cool the market, once last year and once in February this year, but the prices are still rising. The cash-over-valuations are still high. I think we need to do more. I do not want to go into the details tonight. Otherwise, you will remember nothing else about my speech. Tomorrow morning, before the market opens, MND will put out a press statement and Mah Bow Tan will hold a press conference tomorrow. But our purpose is to make sure that in the long term, Singaporeans can own their homes and afford it and it will be a gradually appreciating asset which will grow as Singapore grows so that Singaporeans can benefit.
There are many pieces to this story of immigration and foreign workers and talent and competition and so on and we need to draw all these threads together to manage them holistically and make sure that Singaporeans benefit and the impact of these policies is well-managed. We do not have a ministry to do this, but we will set up a Population and Talent Division in the Prime Minister’s Office. It is like Public Service Division, PSD, which is also in the Prime Minister’s Office with a Permanent Secretary at the ministry level. PMO will cover it, but I will delegate this and the minister in charge of the Population and Talent Division will be Mr Wong Kan Seng and he will coordinate the work of Home Affairs, of MOM, of MTI, of MCYS and make sure that all our policies stick together and the implementation works out well and everything runs okay.
But finally, the success does not just depend on the government policies. It is also the personal links and relationships and how individuals fit into our society and how we accommodate and we welcome them. I give you one real example, Ms Dahlia Ho, who is currently a medical technologist at Changi General Hospital. She helps with the pathologist examining specimens. She came to Singapore from Hong Kong at the age of 14 in the mid-1990s. At first, she was a bit scared of Singapore because she had heard that in Singapore, not allowed to drink Coke, not allowed to chew gum. It’s actually untrue, but that is a rumour and when she went to her new school, she was one of only a few foreigners and she was quite worried about fitting in. But then, the local students found out that she was from Hong Kong and knew about the Hong Kong film-stars and song-stars and so bonded with her because she could share information about these stars with them. When she started working in Changi General Hospital, her supervisor, who is a local Singaporean, guided her, mentored her and made a very big impact on her life because her supervisor was understanding and supportive. When her mother fell ill and eventually passed away, she had to take time-off and the supervisor accommodated her and made adjustments. Because of the kindness shown to her by the Singaporeans whom she came across over the years, she decided to take up Singapore citizenship recently. Now, she is married to a local-born Singaporean whom she met in JC and I hope they have many babies soon.
Immigration is going to be a continuing issue for us. How do we keep the door open while protecting the interests of Singaporeans? How do we welcome citizens while holding on to our values? There are no ideal or permanent solutions to this issue. The measures which I announced tonight will address some of these problems. We will have to manage, monitor, adjust as we go along. But remember, we ourselves are all descendants of immigrants. Our ancestors came poor, but their descendents worked hard and prospered. Had our ancestors not come here, today, Singapore would not exist. So we have to continue to be open today so that we bring in the right people, manage the difficulties whatever they may be so that a generation from now, Singapore will still be thriving and prospering.
For all Singaporeans, whether you are local-born or whether you are a new arrival, education is one of our most important priorities. We all want to give our children the best start in life. We already have a very good system of education which gives our kids a strong foundation, especially in Maths and Science, and makes them effectively bilingual and when they leave school or poly or university, they are competent and employable. But we can do better.
Every child is different, every child has his own interests, his own academic inclinations and aptitudes and our aim should be to provide him with a good education that suits him, one which enables him to achieve his potential and build on his strengths and talents. Talent means talent in many dimensions, not just academic talent but in arts, in music, in sports, in creative activities, in physical activities. It is a system which must work not just for a few top students but catering to all our students. Stretch the brilliant ones but also help those less academically inclined and all those in between. Give each one a tailored and holistic upbringing, so you get academic education, moral education, physical education, art and a sense of belonging and identity. We aim to build a mountain range with many tall peaks but with a high base, not just a single pinnacle where everybody is trying to scramble up one single peak. And we are realising this vision. All our schools are well-equipped with modern facilities, well-staffed with good teachers, each one with his own specialties, whether it is art or the band or uniformed groups or sports, so that in any neighbourhood school, a student can find enrichment programmes and CCAs which will excite him, opportunities to travel, go overseas on exchange trips or study visits and a learning environment that will enable him to grow and do his best.
Let me show you a few examples of the interesting things which our schools are doing. I have taken them from schools all over Singapore. There are art activities, there are music activities, there are dance activities, there are adventure activities, science, a whole of range of things done in many schools all over Singapore. The first group is art - these girls are not doing graffiti. They are drawing a wall mural which they have designed which is quite beautiful. Kids also get a chance to practise batik painting — this boy is obviously very pleased with his creation. And they also do art in other unusual forms, for example, floral displays. This — Naval Base Secondary School had a Floral Club and they participated in the Singapore Garden Festival which was held recently. They put in an entry, here you see their girls putting it together and they won Third Prize.
In music, we have unusual activities too. This one is a fusion orchestra, or called the Nusantara Orchestra at Siglap Secondary School. The teacher responsible travels around Indonesia to find the right instruments to fit into their orchestra and they have got the angklung here, they have got the gamelan instruments here which are called bonang and kulintang and then you have the bells and some Western instruments as well, and all these in Siglap Secondary School.
Primary schools start early. This primary school is performing Mulan, adapted from the Disney musical. They can almost go to Broadway. In dance, you see hip-hop, which I am told in this school doubles as a PE lesson. Or cross-cultural dance - this group was good so they went to Hong Kong Disneyland and performed there. Or traditional Balinese dance - in Bali, Bukit Panjang Government High, this is for students on the EMAS programme, the immersion programme for Malay language and they went to Bali and they are learning Balinese dance.
The NCC does exciting things. It is not just carrying a rifle around, marching and square-bashing. This is not the Singapore Zoo. It is the Rajasthan Desert in India and they are going camel-trekking. Every year, we have an expedition because we have an exchange programme with the Indian cadets. In Science, our students do lab work. These girls are doing DNA profiling as part of life sciences. They make robots. This is primary school children. If you look at the pieces, you will not know what they are trying to do, but it is meant to be a robot which can pick up a ping-pong ball, follow a black line, climb obstacles and then deposit the ping-pong ball somewhere and win some kind of robotic championship. You can see the robot going through its paces.
These are mostly neighbourhood schools which I have picked from all over Singapore doing good work, but not just doing extra-curricular or co-curricular work. They are paying attention to their academic studies too. One of their principals said to me when I asked him what can I tell Singaporeans about you and your school. He says, ""Give us a chance to show what we can do for your children"" because not everybody knows that the schools are doing this kind of work, that in every school, you have caring teachers, you have a nurturing environment and you have the chance to do well and be your best. But being Singaporean, we are never satisfied and we must still do better.
What can we do? In the primary schools, I think we should do more to nurture the whole child, develop their physical robustness, enhance their creativity, shape their personal and cultural and social identity, so that they are fit, they are confident, they are imaginative and they know who they are - I am a Singaporean. We will maintain our strength in Maths and Science, but we need to strengthen soft skills like oral expression, like presentation skills, so that we can raise their language proficiency and confidence, speak up so that they can speak up, whether it is English or Mother Tongue, but give a good account of themselves. We need to pay more attention to PE, to arts and music and get teachers who are qualified to teach PE and Art and Music. We will continue to improve the teacher-student ratios, train more, recruit more, train more specialists and make sure that they get a good foundation in primary school.
At the end of primary school, there is a big examination called the PSLE. Everybody knows about it. In many cases, the parents take the exam together with the kids. I think it is right that the students take exams seriously and the PSLE seriously because it is the basis for how you are admitted into secondary schools and it is a fair and meritocratic system. But I think we should also see exams in perspective, whether it is the PSLE, whether it is the 'O' levels, whether it is 'A' levels. An exam is not meant to be a do-or-die test. It will not determine the whole future of your child. If you do well, that is good. If you did not do quite as well as you expected, there will be opportunities later to do better and to prove yourself again. And in the PSLE, you may or may not get into the particular school which you choose or hanker for but if you cannot get into that one, there will other good choices for you and many good choices. So if you do less well in PSLE than you expect, than you hope, there will be opportunities later to catch up, to prove yourself and to enter competitive programmes later on.
That is how we design our system, that is what we are going to make happen and already does exist to some extent. It is not easy to convince parents. I have met parents who come to see me and they particularly want to go to one school. So I said, in Ang Mo Kio, we have quite a number. I named them a few which I commend to them and they look at me and say, ""Please write for me"". So I will try but I cannot write for all of my residents and if I could write for all my residents, MOE could not say ""yes"" to all my requests. I think we have to see it in perspective and we should not put so much pressure on our kids, which can be counter-productive. But we can do things to lighten this pressure and to give people more good choices at secondary schools. So we will widen the range of options. The most popular programmes, we can replicate and bring to more schools, so that you do not have to go to School A if you wanted to take Programme A. You can have Programme A in many different places.
Like the Integrated Programme, the IP. We are going to expand the IP. What is the IP? It is the ""through-train"", so students who go into the IP, from Sec One, they go through to JC and then they take 'A' levels, but they skip the 'O' levels. If they are confident of making it to university, that is a good choice and we have been doing this for three years now. The results are good. We have got eleven schools doing this and we are going to expand the IP programme to seven more schools in Singapore. I hope that will allow more good students to choose this option and get into an IP programme. The way we are going to do it, these new seven schools are going to have dual track. So if you get into the school, but you did not get into the IP programme, you have a chance later on. Later on, if you do well in Sec One or Sec Two, you can get into the IP programme and then proceed from there. So the PSLE does not matter quite so much. I think that will give more choices to many Singaporeans.
We will also enhance the secondary education for the academically less inclined students. Normal (Tech) students often prefer an ITE approach, the way they are taught in the ITE. So we have tried out to enhance the N(T) programme in several schools. It has worked well and we will learn the lessons from this and we will apply them across the board in N(T) courses across Singapore, so that when you go to the N(T), that is also a good option for you because we will prepare you well to go to ITE. It will be more practice-oriented with industrial attachments and so on.
We started two special schools for the kids who failed PSLE who could not get into N(T). Northlight and Assumption Pathway cater to a small number of students and they have a special mission and a very practical approach. Northlight has a guiding principle. I visited them. These are students who failed PSLE. The schools find it very hard to accommodate them. They have lost confidence in themselves, but Northlight’s principle is every student is a star who can shine as brightly as any others and so the facilities and the curriculum are geared to help the students do well, like this programme where they are being taught culinary skills in the kitchen. And the students gain confidence, they enjoy going to school, they respond. One of them said and, I quote, ""I am not Superman, but I would be more than a bird or even a plane."" It is not bad and the key success factor getting him to that point is to have the teachers with the passion and the training who will build their self-esteem, their resilience and their social skills, emotional skills and get them to want to improve themselves. Learning from Northlight and Assumption Pathway, we will set up two more specialised schools for Normal (Tech) students. So that we have a broad range of options for a broad range of kids.
Beyond secondary, post-secondary school, there are many routes - ITE, Poly, university - and we must make sure that all the students graduate whichever way they go, gain relevant skills and finding good jobs. The polys are a very important institution. They are doing well, getting more students than before and high-quality students and they are doing courses which lead to exciting careers, like courses in pharmaceuticals, like these students from Nanyang Poly. We will enhance this, expand the existing five polys, upgrade the older ones and spend S$700 million improving poly education.
We will introduce the ""through-train"" for the polys as well. Just as you have ""through-train"" to go to 'A' levels, so too for the polys. The good students in the Normal (Academic) stream, instead of going Normal (Academic), 'O' Levels and then Poly, should go Normal (Academic), go to poly, the poly will give the an extra foundation year direct admission and then carry on with the poly course instead of 'O' levels. It is a better use of their time and I think it is something which a Normal (Academic) student should strive for, do well, get into a good poly, do a good course at the poly and after that you can go even further. After the poly, we have the Singapore Institute of Technology, started this year, offering 500 places, offering opportunities for the poly students to get degrees from good overseas universities, getting credit for their work in the poly. So instead of a full three or four-year programme, it takes two years or two-and-a-half years and you get a degree and a good degree and we are building that up too.
Similar to the polys are two other institutions in our system called NAFA and LaSalle. They are doing a good job educating students in arts, design, media, where there is strong demand for these skills, not just to do National Day Parade or YOG, but also in the IRs, in the entertainment industry, digital media industry, in creative advertising, corp comms. Many demands and I think many of our kids have talent to do this. We will support young Singaporeans with such talents to advance through NAFA and LaSalle and go on to get a degree from good overseas institutions, some universities, some equivalent, but the Government will support this undergraduate programme for LaSalle and NAFA students. NAFA is the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.
Then the universities. They are very good, but they have a very difficult job because they take students from such a broad range. 25% to 30% of our students go to university, whereas if you look at Harvard or Beijing University or Stanford, you are talking about a high level at the top, half a per cent and we have to look after good students across this broad range. Hence, the university has to be varied in order to look after all these different students and different aptitudes. And we should offer for our top students opportunities within our system in Singapore to do well so that more of our top students will study here and then perhaps do their postgraduate overseas. NUS and NTU and SMU have been doing this and they have new plans. For example, we have a University Town in NUS which is being built now which is meant to be a residential programme, something like Oxford and Cambridge but maybe adapted, so students will be able to spend two years residential and then be able to have content which will fit them and adapt, and enable them to learn and think and interact better. It is coming up across the road from where we are now. If we show the next slide, you will see this is what it looks like now, but soon, it will look like this. This is Clementi Road, AYE is here and we are here. So, this complex is behind us somewhere in that direction, coming up.
NTU also has plans. We need to train more doctors. We do not have enough, we put a lot of programmes in, we need to train still more. So we are going to start a new medical school in NTU which will be done together with Imperial College in London. We need them. Our population is ageing. We have a bigger population, we need more doctors and this new medical school will enable us to train more doctors, get more Singaporeans to become doctors and also allow us to train more foreign students here to become good doctors, living and working in Singapore.
All this is going to cost a lot of money. The Government will pay more, but the people who attend the courses also will have to pay somewhat more. But we will make sure that we keep it affordable because we will have scholarships, we will have bursaries, we will have loan schemes and we make sure that anybody who can benefit from the education will get that education regardless of his family’s circumstances. One source of funding for the universities which we should build up is donations and endowments, so that if the universities have their own money and can raise their own money, then they can launch new initiatives which will benefit students and not depend all the time directly on government support.
The existing universities have built up these endowments and the Government has helped them to do this and we will do more of this. Over the next 20 years, the government will commit S$4 billion, S$4,000 million to the universities to help them build up these endowments, and create a Singapore Universities Trust. We will put some money in the trust. When people donate to the university, we will match three-to-one for the new ones so please donate generously. For the existing programmes, we will also match 1.5-to-one. So please also donate generously. And we will also encourage donations to the polys and the ITEs because actually, it is not just about the dollars. It is about getting the alumni to be engaged, to pay attention to their alma mater, to want to contribute and help and to build up a good institution. That applies to universities, it applies to the polys, it applies to the ITEs. The universities are already doing this. Graduating classes are donating. Poly students, many of them have done very well in life. ITE, I expect some will too and I hope that they also will do the same. This matching scheme of government grants will also apply to people donating to the polys and the ITEs. Please make the effort because for your alma mater to prosper, the alumni group is what makes the difference.
These are all efforts which will ensure that our students get a good education wherever they go and do well in their lives. It is the most lasting gift which we can give to the next generation. But education has to imbue the next generation not just with knowledge but also with the Singapore Spirit.
What is this Singapore Spirit? It is a very relevant question in a globalised world as Singapore becomes more cosmopolitan and receives more guests and visitors every year. We are proud of our Asian cultures and heritage, the Chinese, the Indians, the Malays and the others and we want to keep this heritage alive and keep this Asian identity. But this Singapore Spirit is not based on a common race or language or religion. It is based on deeper things which we share, shared values like multiracialism or meritocracy or respect for every talent; shared loyalty and commitment to Singapore; shared responsibility for each other and pride in what we have done together; shared memories as well as dreams and aspirations. It is the determination that makes us press on when things are tough, like in the recession last year, the trust that keeps us together when forces try to pull us apart, like when we encountered extremist terrorism after 9/11. It is the competence and the quiet pride and discipline that make sure that things go right, like when we hosted the YOG. It is a confidence that we will prevail come what may. It is this spirit in each of us which makes Singapore work the way it does and which makes Singaporeans special.
Mr Rajaratnam long ago drafted the National Pledge and he wrote, ""Being a Singaporean is not a matter of ancestry. It is conviction and choice."" We have got to maintain a Singaporean core in our society which is stiffened by the Singapore Spirit and around this core we can gather talent and resources and used them to build a better Singapore. As the IT people say, we want to keep an open architecture. The kernel must be protected. Make sure no viruses come in and make it malfunction. But the applications, the peripheral software, can be adapted, extended as circumstances change, as new needs arise, so that we are always current and up-to-date and always with the latest version. And we have to pass this spirit on to the next generation so that they have the same conviction and make the right choices for themselves through the schools but also many other activities - through community involvement, for example, pursuing passionate causes, tacking daunting challenges and trying out many new things, to learn about themselves, to discover their own abilities and to gain confidence and maturity.
We do our best to give our youths such exposure, we encourage them to care for the less fortunate and develop a social conscience, like these students are doing. These are Young NTUC visiting a seniors' home, obviously making a connection with the senior citizens; or protecting the environment - these kids are at Tanjong Chek Jawa, doing some work, rescuing some horseshoe crabs. You see a few horseshoe crabs down here, in good health. They saw us looking at them. And support youths to pursue diverse passions, sports and social activities, like the PAYM Cheerleaders' Group and if this is not exciting enough for you, you can do extreme sports at the Xtreme SkatePark @ East Coast Park.
I am very happy that many of our youths are also venturing abroad and they are volunteering in countries all around us. They go with community groups, religious groups, with Mercy Relief, the Youth Expedition Project and the Singapore International Foundation. They do all kinds of things, disaster relief, medical care and giving tuition. Here is one young man who is doing something interesting, Mr Alvan Yap. He is hearing impaired. He graduated from NUS, he works in the publishing industry, but he is active as a volunteer. This year, he went on SIF's Singapore Volunteers Overseas Programme. He went to Dili, which is in Timor Leste and he is there for a year, teaching deaf children and some adults proper sign language because the kids did not grow up with proper sign language and he needs to teach them the signs and the vocabulary and the grammar and the proper way to communicate. He is also a role model and an inspiration to the kids as well as some adults. Here is Alvan with his class, that is him there and they are saying hello to us. [Video clip: Happy Birthday, Singapore!]. Alvan is here with us tonight. He is on a short break in Singapore. I think he is up there and he will soon be back to Timor Leste again. Welcome, Alvan! I hope more young people will venture forth like Alvan, pursue your dreams and make a difference to others.
One thing we cannot do for the youths, unfortunately, is purposely to create hard times to toughen you up. In fact, we have tried our best to do the opposite, to create a stable and favourable cocoon for Singaporeans to grow up in and young people to grow up in. Last year’s financial crisis might have been a major test, but we emerged more quickly than expected. But the world is still a dangerous place. Nobody can say for the next 50 years, it will be as stable, as peaceful, as prosperous as the last 50 years. Nobody can tell what it will bring.
Dr Goh Keng Swee worried about this problem. Before he retired in 1984, he made a speech where he talked about many things, but amongst them, he addressed this issue and I looked up the archives and I found the tape and let us hear him in his own voice:
Dr Goh: ""A new generation is emerging. This generation has never experienced hardship. Some of my colleagues, by making this statement, seem to imply the new generation has thereby committed some gross misdemeanour. Of course, this is not true.""
Only Dr Goh will say 'gross misdemeanour'. But the new generation that Dr Goh was talking about is not today’s young people, it is 1984's young people. That means us when we were young. But in the quarter-century since Dr Goh’s spoke, I think Singapore has not done too badly and now, my generation is similarly concerned about today’s young people. It is no fault for anyone not to have experienced hard times. It is not any misdemeanour at all. There will be challenges and crises enough in your lifetimes and we will prepare you the best you can and hope that the first time you encounter a real crisis, you will survive the baptism of fire, emerge toughened and so will Singapore.
When Dr Goh passed away in May, Singaporeans were reminded of his enormous contributions to Singapore, in the economy, in defence, in education, and many people lamented that the younger generation knew too little about what he did or how much we owe to Dr Goh and they suggested naming something after him so that Singaporeans would always be reminded of what he had done. I agree. Dr Goh was instrumental in building up the SAF. Here he is, in a colonel's uniform, inspecting officer cadets passing out. He built not just hardware, tanks and fighter jets or battalions and squadrons, but a thinking SAF, with capable commanders and staff and soldiers who can outwit and out-manoeuvre the enemy. Today, much of the hardware that Dr Goh acquired has already been superseded by newer and more sophisticated equipment. This is a Hunter jet. You do not see this on National Day Parades any more, but we would not have F-15s on the National Day Parades if we had not started off with Hunter jets with Dr Goh.
But Dr Goh's emphasis on developing talent and on a thinking SAF endures. The Singapore Command and Staff College is the highest institution for training senior officers in the SAF. It has a handsome home in SAFTI MI and all officers headed for senior positions in the SAF sooner or later will attend advance courses here. We will rename SCSC as the ""Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College"" in Dr Goh’s honour.
From MINDEF, Dr Goh went to education and when he became Education Minister, he totally revamped the system. He made teaching systematic, he introduced streaming, he fostered a high-quality professional teaching service and he began the process of continuous improvement that has created a first-class education system admired around the world. And without Dr Goh’s beginning, it would not have been possible for me to sketch out all those plans which I did just now or what we are going to do next with our education system.
The Ministry of Education has a headquarters at North Buona Vista Road. This is the building. It is expanding its HQ, building a second building next to it, not just for the headquarters, but also to house an Academy of Singapore Teachers and specialist academies for specialist teachers, for English language, PE, Sports and Arts. It is like the Academy of Law or the Academy of Medicine. It is meant to upgrade the professionalism of our teachers, and this complex will be the nerve centre for Singapore education and a symbol of the importance of education to our young and to our future and we will name it the ""Goh Keng Swee Centre for Education"".
Dr Goh did not make his contributions alone. He was part of a team of founding fathers who built our nation. Besides MM Lee and Dr Goh, they included Mr Rajaratnam, Mr Othman Wok, Mr Lim Kim San, Mr Hon Sui Sen, Mr E W Barker, Dr Toh Chin Chye and others. They were a multiracial team with a vision to build a multiracial Singapore and here, you see them attending the first sitting of Parliament after we became independent. This would have been in December 1965. They have experienced and fought racial politics and racial policies while in Malaysia and they were determined that Singapore would be different and in this they succeeded, although the work of building a multiracial and multi-religious society and nation will not be complete for a very long time.
In fact, the founding fathers played a key role in creating the Singapore spirit because before their time, before their generation, the peoples living in Singapore had different loyalties to different countries – to China, to India, to Indonesia – and many of them saw Singapore not as a nation or as a permanent home but as a place to make a living and they dreamed of returning to their birthplaces to retire and to die one day. It was the founding fathers and their generation who conceived of and championed the Malayan identity and later on a Singaporean identity and through the fight for independence, the battles against the communists and the communalists and then the decades of nation-building, led by the founding fathers, the Singapore Spirit gradually took shape.
It is important that the nation remembers the founding fathers properly. It is not just a matter of gratitude, but it is to stay true to the ideals that they fought for and to remind ourselves to continue striving to become ""one united people, regardless of race, language or religion"". It is not yet time to decide how to do so, but it is something that we should think about for the future and which I felt I needed to talk about today.
While we remember the past, we also must look forward to the future. In the same speech where Dr Goh talked about worrying the new generation not being exposed, he also called on a new generation of leaders to come forth and take Singapore forward and here is what he had to say about their responsibility:
Dr Goh: ""You will then regard the present condition of the Republic not as a pinnacle of achievement but as a base from which to scale new heights.""
Not as a pinnacle of achievement but as a base from which to scale new heights and, indeed, we have scaled many new heights since Dr Goh retired. We have got high quality townships, we have got schools, hospitals, Changi Airport, MRT, green and blue spaces, trees and water all over the island and in Marina Bay, a new city is taking shape. We have connected up all the walkways around the bay recently and already, it has become a favourite destination for Singaporeans as well as visitors. Lots of them, day-time, night-time, all around the bay and the bay is getting recognised all over the world as the icon of Singapore.
This is the YOG, either opening or closing. Both ceremonies were held at Marina Bay. Both were spectacular shows against a spectacular backdrop. Here you see one of the items at the opening ceremony. I think we should congratulate the organisers and the performers and the creative minds behind this show. Singaporeans took part enthusiastically in the games and supporting the games and you can clearly see this in the journey of the Youth Olympic Flame. Started in Greece, in Olympia, went through five cities, five continents, including Berlin and then it went on to Auckland, New Zealand, went to Seoul and then it arrived in Singapore where 2,200 runners took it around all our constituencies and towns and lots of people were involved: young and old, in the rain – that is Ng Eng Hen, by the way – and in the sun, on a wheelchair or by dragon boat or flying fox. The women’s Everest team ran, so did NSmen from Jurong Camp and students – this is from Pathlight School – and one extra spunky young man, Low Wei Jie. And it rode the elephants as well as the phoenix and then, Darren Choy took it across the water and lit the flame. [Video clip of YOG Flame being lit].
So, I think the Organising Committee staff, the volunteers, the teachers and students all did a magnificent job, 30,000 of them, all fired up, mostly Singaporeans but quite a few international volunteers too, at their posts, rain or shine, always cheerful, courteous, energetic, putting on the best for the world. The Games Village itself was vibrant and full of life. Our schools participated because each school was twinned with one of the 204 National Olympic Committees. So the schools put up world culture booths to welcome our guests warmly, like this one. I visited on last Sunday and I saw the girls and boys dressed up in the various costumes. So I said to one girl in a costume, I said, ""Where are you from?"" She said, ""I am from Singapore"". Which is quite right, that is a Singapore identity.
Our young Olympians put in their best. All our swimmers achieved personal best times. This is Rainer Ng who got a Silver medal and broke the national record and many of our other athletes also got personal best times. Altogether, we won two Silvers and five Bronze medals. Bravo, Team Singapore! I watched the first Singapore versus Montenegro football game. I saw the players coming onto the field. Ours looked so tiny. Zainudin, who is President of FAS, sat next to me. I asked Zainudin, I said, ""What is happening?"" He said, ""It is under-15"". But the other team's under-15s were six inches taller and bigger. But the Singapore Cubs had good skills, close team work and fighting spirit. So we won 3-2 and we went on to win the Bronze medal. They did good.
The athletes, the visitors, the International Olympic Committee, all were impressed. I think there was a letter in The Straits Times a few days ago which put it nicely. It was by a German volunteer, Mr Uwe Kaufmann and he said, ""If like me, you were at ground zero, you would not have missed the deafening din of positive reactions from representatives of the rest of the world about Singapore. Why? Because Singapore has fleshed out an idea into reality and belief. So, whenever I am asked about my origin, I answer unfailingly and with pleasure: 'I am a Singapore volunteer'. And by the way, I love the catered food"".
But another visitor whom I met at the Games Village, a Canadian lady, looked like an official, put it much more succinctly. She congratulated me, she said, ""Singapore has cleared the bar"". So we congratulate the Organising Committee and all Singaporeans for a job very well done.
The YOG journey shows what Singapore is about — Aim high, prepare well, work together and deliver results. Ours is a young nation. Other countries have longer histories and can claim greater past glories. But Singapore distinguishes itself by its people. We are forward-looking and idealistic. We dare to transform ourselves and our city again and again. Our future is bright. I cannot promise you an effortless cruise, nobody can. We will face storms and challenges and from time to time, have to make difficult choices. But the next decade promises to be a golden one for Asia and, therefore, for Singapore. We may be small, but we are in a very strong position because we have educated our people, we have reinforced our talent, we have worked closely together, delivered results, won respect for Singapore. With good leadership and a close-knit team, imbued with the Singapore Spirit, we will seize the opportunities around us and take our nation to the next level.
Good night.
Aim high, prepare well, work together and deliver results.PM Lee Hsien Loong

   singaporewebsite update april",14353,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister highlighted the nation's robust economic recovery, with an 18% GDP growth in the first half of the year, significantly reducing unemployment and boosting wages and bonuses. This recovery was attributed to the collective efforts of unions, workers, employers, and the government. The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of learning from the recent economic downturn to prepare for future crises, citing Singapore's ability to fund recovery programs like SPUR without incurring debt, thanks to substantial reserves and strong trust among the government, unions, and employers.

Looking forward, the Prime Minister set a realistic growth target of 3-5% annually over the next decade and stressed the importance of productivity improvements across all sectors. He provided examples of individual and corporate efforts towards productivity, including a detailed account of Singapore's global leadership in the construction of oil rigs.

On the topic of foreign workers and immigration, the Prime Minister acknowledged the necessity of foreign talent for economic growth but recognized the social tensions and infrastructure strains this can cause. He outlined measures to manage the number of foreign workers and ensure integration and contribution to society, emphasizing that policies are designed with Singaporeans' interests as the priority.

The speech also touched on the importance of education, with plans to enhance the system to cater to diverse talents and needs, ensuring that every citizen has the opportunity to succeed. The Prime Minister concluded by reaffirming the government's commitment to maintaining a high quality of life for all Singaporeans, fostering a strong national identity, and preparing the younger generation for future challenges."
2011,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans, good evening.
This is my first National Day Rally after the general elections. My team has a fresh mandate to implement our programmes to grow the economy, to improve our education system, to expand our healthcare system, housing, transport and so on. I have a new team that is settling in. It is gelling together to tackle both long range issues as well as immediate challenges which Singaporeans face.
From a national perspective, Singapore has done very well. Over the last five years, we ran into the worst storm we have ever encountered since independence. But we took bold and decisive measures, especially the Resilience Package and the Jobs Credit. The measures worked and sheltered us from the worst of the storm. If you look and compare today with five years ago, I think we can honestly say incomes have gone up some, people have jobs and homes, our city has been upgraded and Singapore is better. But unfortunately, it was such a powerful storm that even with a big and strong umbrella, we could not avoid getting a little bit wet. So Singaporeans felt the discomfort, the anxiety - compounded because of the rapid changes which we could not predict and which left us worrying what tomorrow would bring.
After the crisis passed, our economy bounced back faster than we had expected, which should be good news but it also brought its own problems. Our infrastructure programmes could not quite catch up, there was a shortage in our housing programme, and people became very anxious over their HDB flats. Our public transport became a bit more crowded than it should be and people noticed. From a personal perspective, many citizens feel pressure in their daily lives even though you see the growth figures. Last year 14.5 per cent; this year so far, nearly five per cent, and they ask themselves, why has my cost of living gone up? Can I or my children afford to buy homes for ourselves? What about my healthcare costs as I grow old? In short, Singapore may be progressing, the country may be moving forward, but am I part of this progress, am I part of this story?
I can fully understand and empathise with these concerns because it has been a difficult ride - bumpy, stormy and causing anxiety from time to time. But we are tackling these problems, building more flats, improving our public transport, managing the inflow of foreign workers and immigrants. It will take a while to solve these problems because they are big and complicated issues, but we are heading in the right direction and things will gradually get better. So, please be patient and at the same time, please try and look beyond these problems which we can see as immediate concerns and look to longer-term, wider world issues which affect us and are of strategic importance to us.
We have got to implement long-term policies to keep Singapore growing because otherwise, without the right long-term strategy, there will be no Singapore success story for any Singapore citizen to be part of. Our outlook depends on our getting our strategies right but it also depends on our external environment. If you look around you in the external environment, you do not have to look very hard to notice that some dark clouds are gathering. America and Europe have major problems, still unresolved, which are not just problems for themselves but which pose a serious risk to world growth. In Europe, Greece has been bailed out for now, again, but the markets know that this problem has not gone away. What they have done is to kick the can down the road and sooner or later, it is going to pop up again. It is not just a problem of Greece. It has spread beyond Greece and there are issues with Portugal, Ireland, which can be managed, and even Spain and Italy which are bigger and not so easy to manage. And the banks which lent to these countries, which may be French banks, German banks, banks in Britain - that is an even bigger problem still.
So Europe is troubled. America is also troubled. S&P downgraded America’s long term debt from AAA to AA+. What does it mean? It highlights serious long term problems - government is spending too much, the fiscal deficit is unsustainable and if they do not correct it, they are heading for trouble. But they are not able to correct it because there are deep divisions between the Democrats on one side and the Republicans on the other as to what to do. One side wants to make sure taxes are never raised, the other side wants to make sure benefits are never cut. Therefore the deficit is not going to go down and confidence and growth in the longer term is not going to return. That is the reason why over the last two weeks, you have seen the financial markets go up and down. If you are investing in the stock market, I am sure every day you will be looking at your Blackberry, seeing whether it has gone up or gone down. But the volatility is only a reflection of the real issue and the real issue is that investors around the world lack confidence that these governments will be able to make the hard decisions and to resolve the problems which are deep and very serious.
In Asia, with this global backdrop, China, India and the emerging markets are doing quite well but if America and Europe go into another recession, then I think China and India and the emerging economies will also be affected and vulnerable. Therefore, Singapore has to be watchful. We do not have to press the panic button yet but we have to be watchful because there is quite a possibility that the world will go into another recession and that is going to affect us. It can easily happen. Bob Zoellick, who is President of the World Bank, gave a speech yesterday in Australia and he said as much. Now that he is not a politician, he can say it as it is, so we should take it seriously.
In Singapore we have to keep a twin focus – address the stresses and strains that people feel but also track and respond to our external challenges and keep our long-term strategies right. In other words, we have to get our politics right as well as our policies right and if you can get both of these, then we can engage all our people to build Singapore together. And to get both right, you must start with the politics, which is what I will do.
During the general election in May, many issues got hotly debated and it is quite natural that during a debate, issues will crystallise, be amplified, the differences will be sharpened and people’s consciousness will be focused on the problem. This time there were more diverse views which were expressed a lot more strongly, not only in rallies but also on the Internet, in the social media and SMSes, all the new technology offerings.
It is useful to have had a vigorous debate and a full airing of these views; it shows energy and concern. People are focused on the issues, so let us harness this energy to make Singapore stronger but let it not divide our society. My government will reach out to all segments of Singapore society to understand your perspectives, to share ideas and concerns with you, to work with you to come up with plans and programmes which will benefit all of us. I think there are many concerned Singaporeans who are thinking about this, even after the elections, with critical but thoughtful views. They do not agree with everything the government has done or is doing but they acknowledge the good work and the progress and they are concerned that we should make things better and not throw the baby out with the bath water.
A good number of people like this have written to MPs, to ministers. I have received quite a number myself - thoughtful, cogent presentations of why they think things turned out as they did, and what they think we should do now. I think that people like this give hope that Singaporeans want the country to progress and prove that there are people who are prepared to come forward and to make our system work better. I encourage all those who have written to us in this spirit to come forward, whether online or in real life, and help to strengthen the constructive climate of opinion so that your government can do right for you and do right for Singapore.
I think in person or face to face on TV, we know how to do it. But engagement online, I think we need to learn to do it better. It is not easy to do but it is important because the digital media is continuing to grow in importance. Five years ago YouTube was insignificant, Facebook did not exist; all you had was mrbrown. Today mrbrown has a lot of competition. We in government have a lot of competition and we have to be able to operate in that space. It is not easy because it is anonymous, it is chaotic, it is unfiltered, unmoderated and so the medium lends itself to many negative views and ridiculous untruths, any number of them. I will not repeat one because otherwise you may misunderstand and think it is true. But if you just open at random, you will see them and we have to do our best to counter this, to prevent untruths from circulating and being repeated five, 10, 20 times from leading people astray. After a while, you have heard it so often, you cannot remember where you saw it but you think that it must be true. But it is not.
Our ministers have to get better at this and you know many ministers are blogging now, interacting on Facebook etc. They have to communicate in a different medium and convey nuance, policy, intentions and explanations in a more personal way by engaging people. But it is not just the ministers doing this, the government as a whole has to be more active and adept in engaging Singaporeans online. We cannot be in every corner of cyberspace because there are a lot of cowboy towns out there but there must be places which grow, where people recognise are reliable, where you can have an open debate where different views are expressed; but it is balanced and if you go there, you know that to start off with, you can assume that it will make sense. Whether it is right or wrong, you have to consider the arguments but it is not rubbish.
We have got to get there, be in cyberspace and use it constructively to explain issues, to shape opinions, to rally support and to make Singapore work better. I am very encouraged that Singaporeans are engaging but I am even more encouraged that they are going beyond giving views in order to come forward and to actually work with one another and with the government on projects which matter to them and which are good for Singapore. I will give you a couple of examples because I think that is the most vivid way to convey the things which Singaporeans are getting together and doing and getting mobilised on.
One of them is the KTM railway line, the land we took back on July 1 and on which we are creating a green corridor along the railway. There are many views outside encouraging the government to make this a beautiful green corridor, to add to the amenities of living in Singapore. MND, URA and me, we are very keen on this, so URA has been carrying out an extensive public consultation. Khaw Boon Wan is in charge but Tan Chuan Jin has been personally focused on this and talking to the different nature groups and civic groups outside, looking for creative ways to preserve the green spaces without affecting the development potential of the land which can be developed, because there are lands which can be developed and which should be developed because they are very valuable. But a strip of the railway, I think we can do something interesting with that. We have got many bright ideas, some from students, some from architects, some from design professionals and they sent them to us. They want to use some sections as creative arts and performing spaces. They want to develop a leisure corridor, link them to our park connector network and there are some pictures which you can see. This is Sungei Pang Sua, this is a canal. The actual railway line is just beyond the trees but we can transform this and here is one proposal, to make it look like this. The amenities will be for the residents, for Singaporeans. The canal becomes a meandering stream and the houses behind - their property value is likely to go up. But I think that is good.
There is another proposal from a recent architecture graduate from NUS, Ms Regina Koo, who put some effort into designing a project also around the same area. Her proposal is to build this structure which she calls a “Velo Park”, which means it is a centre for bicycle activities. You have bikeways, you have bicycle rental stalls, a club, a bike café, you can go in and have a bite on your bike. It is creative, it is imaginative and I hope we get many more bright ideas like this and then we will have a range, a menu to choose from. When we have a decision taken and the plans are settled, I hope the interest groups which are engaged in this will actively participate in implementing the projects. So do not just tell us what to do, help us to do it.
This is one interesting project. Another interesting project is the Yellow Ribbon Project which you will have probably heard of, and its objective is to help to rehabilitate ex-offenders, people who are released from prison, and to lower the re-offence rate which we have done quite successfully. In fact we have the lowest re-offending rate probably in the world. There are more than 900 volunteers who give their time and energy, who work closely with government agencies to do this Yellow Ribbon Project. One of the volunteers, Mr Philip Tan, had an idea to do this particular project. If you read it, it says “Dining Behind Bars”. That means for the public to go to prison, to have lunch inside the prison. First you have to go through the bars, these are the guests arriving and the inmates will prepare the meal for you. It is not just a prison meal, it is a special meal because they are being guided by the MediaCorp’s “Chef for Hire” Ryan Hong. Then they eat in style, this is inside the prison and the room is called the Changi Tea Room and this is the chef, Ryan Hong, who masterminded it. You see at the back of the room, they have some pictures. Those are artworks done by the prisoners. After the meal, they have an auction of the artworks. The end result - raise money for the Yellow Ribbon Fund and also let the public know that our inmates are working hard to rehabilitate themselves and that they deserve a second chance. This is the sort of thing which the government cannot do very well by itself as a government department. We can facilitate it, we can encourage it but you need people with a passion who will put their heart and soul into it and dream up new ideas like this.
So that is what we are looking for. Not everything can be done through such volunteer efforts and in government, not every policy can go through extensive consultation. Sometimes, the government just has to deliberate and decide because it is sensitive or there is no time or is an issue where the government has to make up its mind. For example, when it has to do with national security or during crises, you cannot go round asking people what to do. The government has to carry the can. Also even after discussion, we will not always be able to reach agreement or consensus and having heard all the views, the government would have to do what it considers right for the country and then take responsibility for its decision.
Matters can be big or small. We receive many requests every day and not every request to the government can be fulfilled. It could be just to waive a traffic fine or a library fine, it could be just to give a person in the queue priority over other persons in the queue. We may or may not be able to satisfy such requests but whether we can or cannot say yes, we must always maintain courtesy and mutual respect when we discuss these issues. Government departments have to do that, frontline staff have to do that and every day, our frontline staff in the government departments deal with thousands of Singaporeans. Our teachers in schools, our HDB staff at the counters and in the area offices, our town council staff, our hospital staff, PA and the community centres - thousands, if not tens of thousands, of engagements. Most members of the public will be civil and I think most of the time it works well. But some people will press hard and some can be quite demanding. And the agencies tell me that such cases of people being demanding have grown more common in the last few months. And the frontline staff are feeling under pressure.
For example there was one person who went to a government department and at the counter, he wanted something, he could not get it and this is what he told the staff. He said, “I don’t care what your policies and rules are, your job is to make sure that I qualify as a special case. Find the rules, find the right rule to make sure that I am a special case and I want you to do it now”. Now, how would you feel if you were at the counter dealing with this case? How should you react? Can you really say yes? Can the government say yes? Then what happens when the next person comes and says I also want a special rule? So we have to be able to manage such cases. I encourage the frontline staff: do your best, be firm, fair, courteous, even when under pressure. Your job is not easy but it is an important job. Do it well, and we will back you up. I hope the public will also be civil even when you do not get what you are asking for because with restraint and good sense on both sides, we can solve more problems and we can strengthen the relationship between the people and the government.
But beyond attending to matters like this, I encourage Singaporeans to come forward to play a larger and positive role. To sort out issues and compromises together without getting the government, without needing the government to get into the loop. Best of all to take the initiative yourself and to make something happen and to make a difference to the lives of others. One good example of this which I cannot resist showing you is a young man who is a photographer, his name is Sam Kangli and he lives in an HDB block in Tampines. And he realised that his neighbours may see each other every day but they do not really know each other that well, and Kangli is in the audience. So he took the initiative to take family portraits of his neighbours at their doorsteps to help them get to know one another. And here are some of the pictures. So through this exercise taking pictures, he succeeded in breaking the ice and now when the neighbours meet one another they acknowledge one another, they greet one another, there is more small talk in the block and when he comes back and gets back from work, the neighbours who happen to be going out will tell him come, take my parking lot, it is free. So this is Kangli here who took all these pictures.
So I think we look forward to many more examples of active citizenship like this. We are a young nation and we are to develop and to mature, we have to harness our diverse views and ideas, put aside our personal interests and forge common goals. Come to some agreement that this is something worth doing together – let us make it happen. And we need active citizens to change our community for the better. So work with us, make it happen, stand up and do our part to shape Singapore’s future.
If we get this basic working relationship right, then we can get our policies right. I think by and large our policies, the major ones in Singapore, are headed in the right direction. They may need fine-tuning, adjusting; the rough edges have to be smoothed off but we are heading in the right way. I would like to use two examples tonight of broad policy areas to give you a sense of how we should maintain our direction at the same time as we make this adjustment.
One of these policies is foreign workers and immigrants. It is not easy to maintain because these are policies where the benefits are there but they are long term, whereas the downsides are immediate, the side effects are visible and people react to them and we have to respond to this. The foreign workers and immigrants we have taken have given us considerable benefits. Our economy has grown, our population has increased but over the last few years, the changes have been taking place quite fast and Singaporeans worry about the impact on them.
Last year I spoke of this at length in the Rally, so I will not repeat the explanations which I gave you, hopefully you remember what I said last year. I think Singaporeans understand the logic of the policy but the emotional impact, they still feel that and that still causes worry and concern. So I empathise with this and we are acting to relieve the pressures and to make clear that we are putting Singaporeans first. Tonight, what I would like to explain is not the basic rationale which I think you know but to talk about three further areas where we can help Singaporeans to cope with these issues and the consequences of these issues –housing, education and jobs.
Let me start with housing. I think it is at the top of a lot of people’s minds. It is a key expression of putting Singaporeans first. Our home ownership policy ensures that every family has a stake in Singapore. But in the last two years, with property prices going up, spiking up sharply, many people have become unsettled. Young couples especially because they want to get married, they want to book a flat, they want to start their family and no flat means baby is put off. Or worse, they fear they would not be able to afford the homes when they finally get the flat.
So HDB is building many more flats. This year 25,000 BTO flats and I think in recent tenders or recent BTO exercises, the ratio of applicants to flats has gradually been coming down. And we will keep on putting out the supply onto the market. One group who is most worried is those who are earning just below $8,000. It is just below the income ceiling and they fear that they may breach the ceiling. There are more such couples now because people are getting married later, so they are applying for flats when they are more senior in their careers, so their incomes have gone up. There are more women who are working so the family income has also gone up and so they are quite worried because if they are earning $7,500 and you get a promotion, you are not sure whether that is good news or bad news because you may get promoted to $8,500 and then you have to write an appeal to your MP before they get their HDB flat.
We have been studying this for some time, so what we will do is we will raise the HDB ceiling for income per household from $8,000 to $10,000. And for executive condominiums where the ceiling is $10,000 now, we will raise that to $12,000. So we will bring more people into the HDB net and you do not have to worry so much. But the result of bringing more people into the HDB net is that there is going to be more demand for the BTO flats. We have got to make sure that HDB builds enough flats to cope with this extra demand. I have discussed this with Khaw Boon Wan and he has talked to his staff and next year, HDB will be able to build another 25,000 BTO flats, same as this year. And that is a big number. He is quite confident that with these measures, we can meet the demand and we can keep the price of new flats stable and affordable.
However, there is a minority of Singaporeans who cannot afford to purchase flats, cannot afford home ownership and they will need rental flats. We know this and we are increasing the supply of rental flats. Over the next two years, we will add 7,000 rental flats to our supply so we can cater to more families who need this help. We are also postponing the demolition of some SERS blocks so that we can use them as temporary rental units because when you do a SERS project, you build a new block, you move the people from the old block into the new blocks and the old blocks can be demolished and redeveloped in due course. But instead of demolishing them now, we can use them as temporary rental flats until we can relieve the pressure on rentals and we can do the redevelopment a little bit later on. And I think all these measures will ease the waiting time and make things better for households who may be very anxious to get a solution to their housing problems. But I should say that building more rental flats is not really the most fundamental solution to the problems which these households face because their problems are really upstream. They have run into financial difficulties or their families have split up, or there have been some gambling or some business failure, and so as a result they have cashed out on their flat which they already own and now they want a rental flat as another safety net. This is something that we have to study and address because these are deeper social issues, not so easy to solve. But overall, I promise you we will keep housing available and affordable for Singaporeans.
So the first thing we are making a move on is housing. Another area where we need to make some adjustment is university education, university places. Education is one of the issues which is at the top of nearly every Singaporean’s minds; a passionate concern, whether you are a student mugging for the next exam, trying to get into the next institution, next school or you are a parent,kan cheong,worrying about your kid. The university term has just begun and this year a record number of Singaporeans are going to universities in Singapore – 12,000. One in four students of every cohort, every person that age, is going to university. We have never had so many or so big a proportion and I congratulate all of them and their parents for doing well and for taking this significant step in their education. But even then, not all those who applied could be admitted and not all those who got into university got their first choice of course because the competition for courses, the competition for places in some courses, is very intense. For example, in the medical school here in NUS, we have 300 places for medical students but 2,000 students applied to do medical school, and all of them have outstanding results: three As, four As, CCA, secondment, internship, all sorts, whatever is necessary to improve their chances, they have done it. But there is no way that we can take 2,000 so unfortunately quite a number had to be disappointed and we received many appeals from parents and students. I got one myself whom I met in my meet-the-people session and she came to see me. I said good evening, she said good morning. Why? Because she had waited for me and it was about 12.30am by the time she saw me. But it was that important to her, she made the effort.
I get many emails, so have the ministers. I like to quote from one, written by a mother of a student trying to get into university. She wrote a long email but I will just quote one section. She said, “I am very saddened by all the statements made in the general election about “Singaporeans first”. I am not asking for financial help nor housing nor complaining about GST or cost of living. What I am asking for is a place for my child to further his education. Why do not you give him a chance?” So it is a heartfelt plea which I think many parents will empathise with and which we feel too because we read all these appeals and we understand how the parents passionately want the best for their kids. Even so, unfortunately not all the appeals succeeded although this one did. The son was interviewed by NTU, eventually admitted - but I should explain, on his own merits and not because of special intervention by me. But for those who did not get in, my advice is: do not give up. There are many different pathways up, we are providing a good education for all our students, whether or not you go to university or poly or the ITE, or you go to work, and later on you advance into the university - there are many opportunities to keep upgrading yourselves, not just once-off but all your lives. And whichever way you go, do your best, do well because that way you open up more opportunities and that way I think you make it easier for us to help you.
One unhappiness is the feeling that maybe foreign students have taken the place of locals in the universities because our universities do take a proportion of foreign students. Right now they have about 18 per cent foreign students but I should say that these foreign students have not been at the expense of the local student intake because we have steadily increased the number of places for Singaporeans in our universities. So if you look at it, ten years ago, we only had 9,000 students in the universities, Singapore students, as I told you just now, we have 12,000, more than ever. And it is the result of our investments, our programmes to build and our determination to provide as many places as possible for Singaporeans and the best experience for the students who go to university. There are many benefits for the local students to have foreign classmates. It prepares them better for the global workplace, it exposes them to the competition and makes them, spurs them to work harder and give their best and quite often the local and the foreign students will even partner and make new start-ups.
And here is one example of a start-up done by local and foreign NUS students. The company is called BioMers. It produces translucent braces, orthodontic braces, this is the thing they are making and you cannot see it on the teeth because it is meant to be invisible so you can look beautiful or handsome even while you straighten your teeth. The key people in this project are three Singaporeans. The two girls in front: Renuga, who did the research; Karen, who was a research assistant, helped her to do it, both from NUS. Then Mervyn who was also from NUS, knew of this, went to the UK to study, and there he met George, and George is very interesting because George is a Canadian Greek and the two of them developed the technology further to make it commercialisable. They came back and they started the company, and they brought in Bindu who is also an NUS student and he comes from India and so this multinational team set up a start-up.
The startup now has 26 staff and more than half of the staff are Singaporeans. When you have this international mix in our universities, it is good for our students. We have got to keep on doing this but we also have to strike the right balance between the local and foreign students. We take in 12,000 Singapore students annually now at our universities and we are going to expand the intakes further considerably. Over the next four years, we will expand university intakes by 2,000 university places, and that is a lot of places because the whole of Singapore Management University only takes about 1,700 students each year. We are talking about one extra SMU-plus’ intake over the next four years and all 2,000 additional places will go to Singapore students. By 2015 our universities will take in 14,000 Singapore students, more than ever before. But while we do this, we will cap the foreign enrolment at the present levels and therefore gradually the mix will shift and the proportion of foreign students will come down. But this is not the end point because we continue to develop beyond this and beyond 2015, I believe the universities should expand their enrolments further because the economy will need more graduates and our schools and our polys are producing more students with good results and many of our students passionately want to go to university and have the grades and the capability to benefit from a university education. I think we should allow as many as possible to have that opportunity. MOE is studying how best to do this - may not be just from expanding the existing universities, maybe we have to open new routes. It is something we should study further.
But whether it is houses, whether it is university, whether it is jobs, which I am coming to next, we put Singaporeans first but in an open-minded sort of way. For jobs, we have let in a steady inflow of foreign workers into our economy at all levels and because of that, our economy has thrived and we have full employment - everybody has a job. All Singaporeans, nearly every Singaporean is working. Unemployment is only about 2.2 per cent overall but still I know that Singaporeans worry about competition from foreigners.
Sometime ago I had a dialogue with young people and one polytechnic student asked me this very direct question. He said: “You know you have the ‘S’ pass for people who are one level above the work permit. Why do you set the S pass qualifying salary at $1,800?” Why did he ask me that question? Because really what he meant was $1,800 is less than what many poly diploma holders are earning. Poly diploma holders earn more than that. If you set the level there, you are going to have people who will be earning less than us but competing against us, so why do you let the foreigner compete directly against me?
I understand those feelings but we need some non-Singaporeans to complement the Singaporeans and to make up our shortfall. But at the same time, we also realise that it is important that Singaporeans remain the core of our workforce. We cannot become like the Gulf states where 80 per cent of the people who are working are foreigners and if you go there, whether it is the person in the hotel, whether it is the bank, whether it is the airport counter, or any of the jobs, it is foreigners working and we cannot be like that. We have tightened up on foreigners progressively. We have tightened up the foreign workers levy, we have tightened up on the dependency ratios. The ‘S’ pass we have pushed from $1,800 to $2,000, that is of some help to the poly diploma holders and people who are at that level and therefore we have protected Singaporean workers, especially at the lower end. But we also have to be mindful of the impact on companies, especially local SMEs, because they need the foreign workers the most and if we squeeze out the foreign workers too drastically, we are going to kill the SMEs. We are helping the SMEs to adjust: grants, tax deductions, all sorts of schemes to help them to upgrade their productivity and we have to bear that in mind when we settle our policies.
At the top end of the workforce, we have to allow high quality professionals and entrepreneurs because they grow our businesses here and help Singapore compete internationally. If you look at what we are doing, at the bottom, we are tightening; at the top we have to be free. In between we have to make some adjustments. The middle, the lower middle level - foreigners are here, many on employment pass. Singaporeans are working - they are probably graduates or diploma holders, not hard up, not unskilled but not so confident of themselves that they are ready for unrestrained competition. They are feeling vulnerable, worried about what may happen. I think at this middle level, we need to tighten a little bit further. We need to raise the salary requirement for the employment pass holders, tighten up the educational qualifications, make sure they come with real skills valuable to us and this is something MOM has worked on and will announce details soon. MOM will also work with tripartite partners, so as to develop guidelines for fair employment practices and responsible recruitment practices so that when you have a Singaporean working side by side with a foreigner, they both feel fairly treated and nobody feels that he is at a disadvantage. This is something which we will work together with the unions and employers.
But I should caution you on one thing - just because we are tightening on foreign workers does not automatically mean that Singaporeans will get better jobs or higher pay because the competition is not just the foreign worker here. You are competing with workers all over the world. Unskilled workers have felt this for a long time but increasingly our graduates and professionals are also seeing this happen. In China every year seven million graduates graduate from university, double the number of Singaporeans. Of these, 1.5 million are engineering and science types. They are hungry, they are competitive and they are competing furiously with one another in China and I think the impact will be felt around the world for the next 20 years, including us. It is really a tidal wave, a tsunami coming in our direction and the only way to get out of the trouble is to rise above the tsunami by training ourselves, developing expertise and doing things which they cannot do yet in China but which we can do now in Singapore so that we can make a living for ourselves in order to improve our lives. But even if we do that, we have to accept that if we bring down the number of foreigners, slow the inflow, it means slower growth, less economic growth, somewhat less vitality, companies will come here not so vigorously or they may choose to expand elsewhere and we will have less resources to improve our lives. You have got to find the right balance.
Yes we will moderate and manage the foreign workers but we have to bring in enough so that we have the manpower and the talent to grow and to prosper. This is what we must do when it comes to putting Singaporeans first, stay open but moderate our policies, solve the problems, whether it is housing, whether it is education, whether it is jobs. It has worked, we have brought global winners here and we have created prosperity for Singaporeans.
One example of this is Lucasfilm Singapore. Last year I talked about them but I think this year there is something interesting to share with you again. Lucasfilm in Singapore has 500 employees from 36 countries; nearly half of them are Singaporeans, skilled people, animators, visual effect artistes, engineers. Many of them graduated from our polys which have very good digital arts and digital animation courses and the team here has helped to produce many successful movies. I showed you “Clone Wars” two years ago but the latest movie which we have been working on here is “Transformers 3: Dark of the Moon” and I will show you just one short clip done jointly by the team here and the team in San Francisco. Those of you who watched Transformers movies will know that this is a movie clip of Bumblebee: 10 seconds on the screen or eight seconds on the screen but more than 10 people worked on it - layout, simulation, animation, lighting, all kinds of skills, highly-refined. This is only possible because you have this very diverse team with all the people from all around the world put together to make it happen. Let us stay open, keep current with new ideas and trends, stay ahead of the competition and let us stay a confident, forward looking and successful society.
The second area of policy which I would like to share with you to show how we are keeping our direction while adjusting our implementation is our social safety nets - how we need to care for one another. We are living in a time of rapid changes. Last five years you have seen the changes. Over the next five years, I think there will be many unexpected surprises to come and it is important that nobody is left behind as we dodge and shift and find our way through the troubles.
We aim for inclusive economic growth. We want to encourage people to be self-reliant, for families to give mutual support to one another and to be able to look after themselves as much as possible, but there will be a minority who cannot keep up or who will fall on hard times. For them, we need a social safety net. The way we have done it which I think has been successful has been to give people assets, especially an HDB flat; help them become self-reliant by giving them a very good education, provide them affordable medical care through the 3Ms - MediShield, Medisave, Medifund – and also government subsidies through the hospitals, and then to have targeted assistance to those who need help through many helping hands. The result is that nearly all citizens are employed, housed and able to look after themselves.
The last five years have been stressful and so we have introduced new programmes which have helped - Workfare to raise the incomes of lower income Singaporeans, Comcare to provide tailored support for individuals and families with specific needs. Since we introduced Comcare six years ago, we have had 200,000 people helped by the schemes. So we have got a blossoming of all kinds of local programmes involving community leaders, the grassroots groups, the VWOs, doing interesting things on their own initiative with government support and backing. For example, they distribute food to needy households or they teach low income families budgeting skills. This is not Monopoly, this is called “Moneywise” and it is a programme introduced by Southeast CDC to teach low income families how to manage and budget their money and is quite successful in getting them to be able to save, to allocate and to learn how to cope. Or we have people who are befriending the elderly, taking them on outings. This is a group who took wheelchair-bound elderly to Marina Bay, I do not think to the casino. Or maybe you just take them out for a meal and enjoy some companionship together in a hawker centre and cheer up their day, add some warmth and brightness to their lives. That is how I think we can make a big difference to the lives of Singaporeans who need help.
The next five years - there is going to be rapid change. Our aging population is going to throw up new challenges and there will be other groups which will have specific needs which we have got to tackle. We will keep on improving our social safety net, enhancing it, keep the present approach but improve the schemes and I would like to talk about two things which we will be doing tonight.
One is to do with medical care and particularly with outpatient treatment, especially for older people. Many Singaporeans worry about medical expenses, especially if you are older or you have an elderly member in your family. The 3M framework, Medisave and so on, works well for inpatient care but for outpatient treatment, I think we can do better. One group of these elderly is those who need long term care. They may be bed-ridden or they may have Alzheimer’s and I talked in the Chinese speech just now of some of the things we are doing to help this group. We will give more support, expand services, make the services more affordable.
Another group is patients who have chronic ailments, maybe high cholesterol, maybe high blood pressure, maybe diabetes and amongst the people who are in their 70s maybe half will have one chronic ailment or another. When you have something like this, you will know that you need regular checkups and you need long term medication. It is not that you take the pill 10 days and the problem is cured. You have these pills, take it for the rest of your life, every three or six months see the doctor, the doctor will examine you, adjust the dosage, six months later see again. Try and keep well for as long as you can. But the pills can be expensive, particularly over a long period of time and the low income patients tell me they may skip an appointment because they fear they cannot afford the pills. Or they may say “the doctor says I eat this every day but I take it every other day instead to save money”, which is not the way it is supposed to be done because if you do that, your condition will worsen and more trouble will come later on, serious complications.
I think that we should make outpatient care more affordable and accessible for this group: the elderly and the not so elderly. We have a scheme to help elderly chronic patients like this. It is called the Primary Care Partnership Scheme (PCPS), which helps the low income elderly and disabled. What it means is: you have a card, you are registered, you can see your GP instead of going to the polyclinic but you get a subsidy like you are going to the polyclinic. It is more convenient, you have more choices and you probably get faster service. We will change this scheme which is now quite restrictive and where you have to be 65 years old before you are considered for this scheme. We will change it so that you can start at the age of 40. Because when you have high blood pressure or cholesterol or diabetes, by the age of 40 it is beginning to show up particularly if you have not looked after yourself. When you have conditions like this, the earlier you start treating, the better I think the results will be and you have to cooperate and we will improve the scheme to help you to be able to have consistent treatment over a long period of time.
We will also revise the income criteria to include more households so that a broader range of households can come in under the scheme and can get consistent good long term care. We will also make the medication more affordable to lower income households. We will expand the drug list so that it covers more drugs and we will increase subsidies for the more expensive drugs with safeguards so that those with chronic ailments or cancer where chemotherapy can be very expensive, well you will get more help. I think these are major moves. We will implement them carefully and as we gain experience with them, we can consider how to fine-tune and how we can take further steps forward. We have to be very careful because you do not want to end up like the Americans where the government health schemes have eaten up a huge amount of the budget and financially and fiscally it is a big problem for them. But we can do better, we will do better and MOH is working on it and they will announce the details later on. So this is one area where we can improve our social safety nets.
The other area has to do with families who have children with special needs. They may have dyslexia, they may have autism. They may be ESN, they may be hearing impaired or one of so many conditions but they have long-term special care and education needs. The families will worry not just over the cost but also about helping them overcome their disabilities and develop to the maximum, so that they get the right stimulation, right education and training, right coping strategies. The government is already supporting people doing this. We support early intervention, we support special education schools. We also have support in mainstream schools for children with mild learning disabilities like dyslexia.
The special education schools are doing good work. One example is Pathlight School which happens to be in Teck Ghee. It looks a beautiful building and it is for children with autism, now it has got about 600 students. I know because I visited it and I held my National Day observance there this year recently. These are the Pathlight students performing and they presented me a beautiful drawing. It is a drawing of Joo Chiat shophouses done by one of their students. So it shows that you may be a special education student but you can have very special abilities too. And in the right environment, they can thrive.
But there is a long queue for places in some of the special education schools, and I often meet parents asking me for help to get their children in. So we will expand capacity in the special education schools and also in the mainstream schools and we will strive to raise the quality of the special education schools so that the children get education which will help them to overcome their disabilities. We will also increase financial assistance for households who need more help. This is something which the Ministry of Education will do together with MCYS, consulting the community to work out the best approach because this is something which needs many helping hands.
The community has to play its part to help to integrate those with special needs into our society. And one good example of a ground-up effort, not depending on the government, is the Joan Bowen café. Joan Bo Wen is a young lady with special needs. Her parents wanted to solve her problem; they wanted a safe working environment for her. So what did they do? They opened a café and they called it the Joan Bowen café. The café is at Jalan Wangi which is in Sennett Estate and it is to help youths with special needs like autism or Down’s Syndrome so it has got a crew of 16 staff of such kids, actually adults, and they are trained to run the whole café. Here you see them cooking and this is Joan in the middle, putting the sauce onto the dish. They learn food preparation because they have a manual with pictures and detailed instructions - exactly how to do, each step what to put next and with patient guidance, gradually they gain confidence and they are able to serve customers. You see the customers are happy and the café is successful, so they have launched a second outlet at St Andrew’s Village. So if you have a chance and you live near there, please drop in and have a drink.
So we will do our part as the government but the community, parents, VWOs please come forward, help us to carry this and deal with this challenge. You can do a lot. We will progressively improve our social safety nets, update our basic schemes whether it is the CPF, whether it is the Medisave schemes and so on. And we will do more for other groups which have special needs as these issues emerge and we will keep up our effort to help the poor, make sure that nobody is left behind. But while we do all these things, we have to be very careful that we do not become a welfare state.
Take the example of Greece, you know it is in trouble but why is it in trouble? It is a small country, population is about twice ours, the GDP is about twice ours and its former prime minister Papandreou - a generation ago he built a generous welfare system, protecting the Greeks from competition, giving them jobs in the government, welfare benefits, pension benefits, but it was not affordable. And so the country has gone broke and has been set back for many decades. Now Papandreou Jr, the son, is trying to wind back these benefits and put the country right again. It is very painful, it is going to be very, very difficult and even then they cannot do it by themselves. They are being bailed out by the EU, so far twice, and the problem is not settled. In Greece, if you run into trouble, the EU is there to look after you. In Singapore, if we run into trouble, who is going to be standing there helping us to get out of the hole? So I think the best thing is: do not get into the hole and maintain a sense of self-reliance and personal responsibility because that is best way for us to succeed.
Our competition is not getting less worldwide; it is getting more competitive than ever. We cannot afford to think that we do not have to try hard because the state is there and if something happens, we can always fall back on the government.Cheng hu wu lui(“the government has money” in Hokkien) - that is the most disastrous thing you can say and the most harmful to Singaporeans because you are misleading them and it will lead to big trouble. Singapore can only succeed if every one of us works hard, does our best and helps others to make progress together. Then we will prosper and we will have the social safety nets which work for us.
Tonight I have talked about these two sets of policies as examples, putting Singaporeans first and enhancing, working together with each other, to show you how we can keep the thrust of our policies but adjust them to deal with specific problems. We will do it with education, with healthcare, with transport, so many other things, not just once-off but progressively because as we go forward, we will encounter new situations, new problems will come and we will have to respond to them and adjust and make new policies. But where the strategic direction is correct, where we are basically sound and we have a temporary problem to deal with, I think we should have the courage and the honesty to say we are doing the right thing, let us tackle this problem, let us not throw out the baby with the bath water, it is very dangerous.
After the general election, investors have been watching us very closely. They have asked us directly whether Singapore is changing course fundamentally because our society is changing, our economy is changing, our politics are changing. What new Singapore will it be? Will we respond to the pressures of the day and become like so many other countries - short term and reactive - or will we maintain our strengths? As ESM Goh put it yesterday, will our politics remain pragmatic or will we become populist? That is a very direct question, an important question which they have asked us.
EDB just celebrated their 50th anniversary, I went for their events and I met many of the CEOs who came here. I think they came here not just because it was the 50thanniversary but because it was after the general elections and they wanted a sense of how Singapore is, what it is like. They asked me will Singapore change. In other words, has Singapore’s political risk gone up? So I reassured them that we are determined to keep our strengths, that we know what Singapore’s prosperity depends on, what our well-being depends on and Singaporeans know what our well being depends on, and we will maintain the policies which are important for us and therefore useful for them. At the dinner for the CEOs at the anniversary, this was my message. They listened carefully to me, I think they took me seriously, they accepted that we had the resolve to do this but I can tell you honestly they are also waiting to see what we will do. If I were them I would also wait to see what Singapore will do. So make sure we do the right thing, so that they continue to invest, we continue to have good jobs and Singapore continues to prosper because that is what our future depends on.
Looking ahead, we face more complex challenges but we can create an outstanding future together. What we have today is special, do not take it for granted. It is an extraordinary achievement, the result of hard work by a united population over many years working with good leaders, making Singapore an exceptional country. Whether you go to the developed world for a holiday and come back, whether you go to the neighbouring countries in our region and come back, I think if you are honest, you know when you come back to Singapore, you say I am glad to be home because this is a place where there are very few others like it in the world. People know this. I think our people know this, I think many people in the world know this and our Singapore brand is respected all over the world. Everywhere we go, we are proud to be Singaporeans. If you look away from the policies, away from the details, all the fine print of the schemes and the programmes and so on, I think we have one basic choice which we have to make at this turning point and the basic choice is this – what sort of Singapore do we want to be 20 years from now?
Do we want to be still an exceptional country, one which is unique and which people look up to around the world? Or are we content for Singapore to be an ordinary country getting by but no different from so many other cities all over Asia? It is not hard to be ordinary. You can get by but without a hinterland, it will become just like any other city in Asia, then there is no reason for people to be here to invest here, for talent to stay here or even for able Singaporeans in the next generation to want to remain, and then Singaporeans may leave for bigger and better opportunities elsewhere. If we want to continue to be exceptional, then you must make a special effort to look ahead, anticipate problems and opportunities to build for the long term, patiently, resolutely, year by year, whether it is good or bad and to keep our politics pragmatic and constructive so that the political basis is there for us to do work which makes sense for Singapore and for us to work together for a common goal. I believe that to keep Singapore exceptional is a goal well worth striving for. We have shown that we can do it, otherwise we would not be here today and now we have the opportunity to build something which is truly outstanding in Singapore, and as the song (Count On Me Singapore) says, “show the world what Singapore can be”. We deserve it, our children deserve no less because we want our children to grow up in a city, in a country which they are proud of and which is something special and enables them to flower to the maximum. It is a basis on which we are planning and we are moving on the programmes in Singapore to develop our economy, our education and so on over the next five years.
I will not go through all these programmes but I would like to share with you just some pictures just to give you a sense of the things which we are doing and why they are worth doing. We are developing new growth industries for example, precision engineering. Companies here used to make TV and radio components, now they produce sophisticated products and this thing which is being made in Singapore is equipment to make semiconductors, so you are not just having semiconductor production lines here where they make wafers and the chips, but you are making the machinery to make the wafers and the chips in Singapore, one level up. You do not put that in any ordinary country.
We are developing our infrastructure. You probably have not seen this part of Singapore. It is deep underground, it is the Jurong Rock Cavern because under Jurong Island, there is a big granite formation. We are excavating caverns in the granite formation to provide storage space to support our petrochemical industry. You can store oil, you can store petrochemicals, because you have the storage space, so we can have a petrochemical industry here. Because this is Singapore and the industry is confident to be in Singapore, so a hole in the ground in Singapore is valuable whereas elsewhere you can find holes in the ground for free.
Healthcare - we have built the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. This is a vegetable garden but it is a vegetable garden on the roof of the Khoo Teck Puat hospital, managed by residents in Nee Soon living nearby, volunteering, a community effort. Keep the roof green, keep the patients cheerful and meanwhile they get some vegetables and fruits and flowers, they have even got coconut trees on the rooftop. The next hospital is coming - Ng Teng Fong Hospital in Jurong – in three years’ time and thereafter, I hope not too long after that, a new hospital in Sengkang.
In education, we have got many things coming on but I think this picture is the most beautiful. It is not a university. That is ITE College West in Chua Chu Kang, opened this year and it looks like a university and what is inside it is even more interesting. They run classes; they have got cooking classes, culinary classes and this one you see is a French chef and French students. They did not join ITE, they are there because the ITE course is run jointly with the Institut Paul Bocuse in Lyon, France, and here the students and instructor have come from France to spend time in the ITE and they are teaching the students to prepare a three-course meal. The next ITE is ITE Central and I think the buildings will be better. It is in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 and will be opened by 2013.
We are building new townships - this one is already there, Punggol 21, Treelodge@ Punggol, but many more flats are coming up in Punggol and Punggol New Town when it is done - this is the artist’s impression of one of the views. So our new towns, our HDB estates will be different and they will not just be HDB estates but they will be in an urban landscape because we are going to have the greenery all around it. In Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay is almost complete. It will be done by 2012 and if you go inside, you will have lush greenery and it is not just going to be at Marina Bay, we are going to have parks and gardens at the heartlands also. This one is Bishan Park and eventually we will have this in many other parks in Singapore, in the west, the east, in the central area and we will link them all up to create a City in the Garden.
So we are building to keep Singapore special and exceptional but even more important than our physical investments is our people - building the sense of ownership and belonging, the instinct to stick together through thick and thin, the drive to surmount every challenge and persevere year after year to make Singapore better. We will be a more diverse society, it will be a challenge but we have got to strengthen the forces that unite us and overcome the forces that pull us apart.
We are Singaporeans together on a small island. We are anchored by our emotional links with family and friends and by our shared sense of our history and our common destiny. We are not just here, materialised out of nowhere, appeared out of a Transformers movie maybe. We came here somewhere, sometime there was a history to it and it is crucial to remember where we came from, how we got here. Whether it is Geylang, whether it is Little India, whether it is events which we live through, important milestones - these are the human stories of people, ordinary people who struggled to improve their lives and lived through war or hardship or the turbulent early years of independence, and they achieved extraordinary results with good leadership. They had fulfilling lives and they made Singapore special.
Recently, I attended the launch of Singapore HeritageFest and I made a speech about these human stories and emphasised how important they were. It prompted a response in the TODAY newspaper by a lady, Angeline Koh, who is working on digital storytelling and I think I should read a little bit of what she said because it resonated with her. She said, “What are memories and shared experiences but stories. And storytelling is what Singapore as a nation needs. There are unsung heroes in our midst, there are people we meet each day in our homes and in our schools, at work and in play. Our children need to realise they are heroes in the making. They have the power to become heroes by the brave and sacrificial choices they make to live well and for the good of others”. When we talk about history and national education and a sense of belonging, it is not just words and abstract concepts. It is really the stories of people, real people, what they lived through, what it meant for them.
That is why MICA is launching a Singapore Memory Project to capture, preserve and showcase these memories. They hope to collect five million memories by 2015 because that is our 50th anniversary. The stories can come from anybody, any person, any community, any organisation or institution which has experienced Singapore. Together all these individual stories will weave the tapestry of our nation. They started in July, so far they have collected 30,000 plus stories and I have not read all of them but I just picked up two memorable accounts to share with you.
One is by a Mr James Seah who lived through the Bukit Ho Swee fire in 1961. I read what he said and I looked up some footage and some photos of the event and it brings back to life a very traumatic moment for this young man. ""There was a dark billowing smoke in the sky, the smell was toxic. People were shouting fire, fire, screaming, shouting. My mother and I ran as fast as we could to flee away from the burnt houses. There was a stampede, the older and weaker people were carried by younger and stronger ones. I noticed my neighbour’s daughter knelt down on the ground to pray, staring at a darkened sky of smoke. They ended up in Kim Seng School. The school compound was crowded with thousands of fire victims, police, military personnel, doctors, nurses and helpers. Tents were erected for registration of fire victims, cooking utensils to cook on the spot and supply meals. There was also milk powder for babies. My family visited the fire site and saw the shocking scene of the aftermath of the fire the following day. Within a week my family was allocated a HDB two-room flat at Margaret Drive."" That is one aspect of Singapore and how we got here.
Another story, more cheerful, is the memory of Malaysia Cup 1994 - Singapore versus Pahang and this was by Mr Muhammad Raydza. I read his account: “I love showing support to the Lions battling it out at Malaysia Cup. I was 17 years old then, a mere schoolboy. When we were walking toward the stadium, there was this feeling of euphoria and anxiety, anticipating the match as everywhere we went fans of both sides were in their best country’s colours. The feeling was simply awesome when the final whistle was blown as if the whole of Singapore was there at Shah Alam.” I asked if we had the movie clip, so I will share it with you. Mr Muhammad Raydza’s comment is worth sharing with you too. He said, “The most memorable moment during the whole Malaysia Cup to me was not the players, instead, the integrity of the fans to come together as one and only in this competition where we see strangers become good friends and buddies become family. This is what I am definitely hoping for in the next Malaysia Cup, and not so much of the win”. But I hope the Lions win too.
As we strengthen the sense of our common path, we must look ahead to create our shared future. We aim to be a fair and just society that nurtures and inspires the human spirit, a society that encourages people to go forth and do well for themselves and do good for the community. It depends on Singaporeans believing that we have created something special and precious here that we must protect and improve, striving not just for material success but for ideals and dreams, serving with passion and the heart as well as the mind. We place our hopes in our youth who are Singapore's future. There are many young people who champion and volunteer for good causes big and small, searching for ways to give back and found many ways to give back.
One such young man is Mr Haridharan s/o Jaganathan. He was born with cerebral palsy, but it did not deter him. He went on to do well for himself and he is making a big effort to help others. He graduated from Ngee Ann Poly and now he is working for the Ministry of Finance. This is his office, Vital Shared Services, and he is active in community work in the poly, in the NYC, National Youth Council, in grassroots organisations, even in the Toastmasters Club. He also mentors other youths to do good for the community. Last year, he took part in the YOG torch relay and I quote what he said, ""my greatest achievement is in adapting to society with what I have and at the same playing my part in making it better, for this society is mine"".
Another young man who has also committed himself, done well for himself despite difficulties and difficult family circumstances and is contributing back is Mr Muhammad bin Mohd Jauhari. He is the eldest of five siblings. His parents divorced when he was nine years old. His mother who is Malaysian, took him back to Johor and he continued to study in Singapore. Every day a four-hour bus ride and he had to grow up quickly because the father was not in the family and he was the eldest sibling and he had to be the father figure in the family. Every day, four o’ clock in the morning, get up, go to school and not only made it on time for lessons but topped his cohort in ITE College West this year, won the LKY Model Student Award and got direct entry into electrical engineering in Ngee Ann Poly second year and he is in Ngee Ann Poly now. He is an active volunteer in the ITE, he is an active volunteer in the Southwest CDC and also last year in the YOG. Here is what he said when we asked him: why do you do this? He said,” the reason I strive to be better is to improve on my own weakness and it is my successes that ensure the well-being of my family. As a son it is a responsibility I proudly carry and uphold”.
Young people like Hari and Muhammad embody the Singapore spirit. They are not alone, there are many more Singaporeans like them, young and perhaps not so young and they are creating opportunity out of adversity, proving we can when others say we cannot, striving to make life better for our fellow men.
Our task, this generation, is not just to make a beautiful Singapore to pass on to the next generation. Our task is to engage many more young people like Hari and Muhammad to make building this nation, building Singapore, their own mission so that they embrace this passion, this responsibility to keep on transforming our nation for the better. We can and we must make this a special place we all call home, where we not only prosper but live in peace and harmony, where we not only have careers and opportunities but friends and families where we share not just burdens and rewards, but our worries and our joys, where we make tomorrow always a little bit better than today. Let us work together as one people to continue to build a bright future for Singapore which will always be our home. Thank you very much. Good night.

   singaporewebsite update april",12600,"In his National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister of Singapore addressed several key areas of development and concern following the general elections. He emphasized the government's commitment to tackling both immediate challenges and long-term issues, with a focus on enhancing the economy, education, healthcare, housing, and transport systems.

The Prime Minister acknowledged the economic recovery post-crisis, but noted the accompanying infrastructure strains, including housing shortages and public transport congestion. He reassured that measures are being taken to improve these areas, including managing the inflow of foreign workers and immigrants, and asked for patience as these complex issues are addressed.

He also highlighted the external economic risks from global uncertainties, particularly from the US and Europe, and stressed the importance of maintaining vigilance and preparedness for potential recessions that could impact Singapore.

The speech also touched on the need for political stability and constructive politics to ensure effective long-term strategies for Singapore's growth. The Prime Minister called for active citizen engagement and participation in shaping the future of the country, emphasizing the importance of community involvement in both policy-making and social initiatives.

Overall, the Prime Minister's speech outlined a vision for Singapore that balances immediate responses to citizens' needs with strategic long-term planning to ensure the nation's continued success and stability. He called for unity and collective effort to overcome challenges and seize opportunities for the future."
2012,"
Friends and fellow Singaporeans
We have travelled from Third World to First. You know the Singapore story to date well. Our question is what is the next chapter of this story? Where do we want Singapore to be 20 years from now?
The next 20 years will see many changes in the world. The first big question will be: will there be peace or instability in the world, and in Asia? If it is not peaceful, if there are tensions, then we must brace ourselves for a rough ride. But if there is peace and prosperity worldwide, which looks likely, then it is going to be an exciting era of rapid progress and dramatic change.
We are both a country and a city. So when we look forward into our future, we have to see our future against what other countries are doing and also against what other cities are doing in the world. In Asia, I expect many countries will continue to rise and especially the biggest ones – China and India. And they will compete against us in many business areas – manufacturing, services, R&D and in some areas they will surpass us and some parts of China and India will certainly surpass us. But at the same time, these big giants will offer many opportunities for Singaporeans. Their cities: Shanghai, Beijing, Mumbai, Bangalore will become even more vibrant and exciting places to live and work. They already are, not quite so comfortable, not quite so clean environmentally but they will improve and for their people, it will be exciting. For Singaporeans, it will be very pleasant too. In the developed countries in the West, the change may not be so dramatic and their problems will also not be so easy to solve, like the problems which the Europeans are going through now. But their leading cities, like New York, Los Angeles, London, these I believe will continue to thrive because they are not only connected to their own countries and the problems in those countries, they are connected to the whole world. Talent flows in, resources flow in, ideas come in, new projects, new companies start up, new changes which influence the world. And we have to see ourselves against those cities and ask us where do we want to be.
One of the big changes in the world which will change the world will be technology. It will completely transform our lives. Already it is a huge part of how we live, work and play. We do not always realise it but it is. If I ask who in this room does not own a handphone, please put your hand up. (No one does.) You know what I mean. But think 20 years ago how it was in 1992, not a lifetime ago, just 20 years. It was not like that. People used coin phones, card phones. When recruits were called in camp, confinement, queue up to phone home, like that (points to picture of recruits queuing for public phone on screen). Today when you are called up or when your sons are called up BMTC Pulau Tekong, the first night the instructors tell them please use your handphone, call home. Call your mother first, then call your girlfriend.
In 1992, the Internet had not yet come to Singapore and nowhere in the world did anybody imagine Facebook or Youtube, or how these gizmos and new fangled things would impact societies, impact our lives. And today Singapore is one of the most wired countries in the world. So just think back those 20 years and ask yourself how you can imagine what 20 years from now will be like. Not just the technology but what the technology has done to our lives. I just give you a few examples of things which we can see now, which I think will be big in the next 20 years. A lot of it to do with IT, with computers, with robots. The first one is this mysterious thing (points to picture of UAV on screen). This unidentified flying object was seen at a BMT passing out parade on the (Marina Bay) floating platform recently. It created buzz on the Internet. People asked is this a secret spy project belonging to MINDEF. So I asked MINDEF, “is this a secret spy project?” MINDEF told me, after investigating the matter carefully, they said no, it has nothing to do with me. This is a UAV, an unmanned aerial vehicle. No pilot but it flies, it is smart. And whom does it belong to? Jack Neo filming his latest movie, ‘Ah Boys to Men!’ It is just one of many users which UAVs will have in the future. Militaries use them – reconnaissance targeting, communications; civilians use them. You can use them for crowd control, you can use them for civil defence purposes, you can use them to manage crops, to keep track of what is happening on broad areas. So many countries are interested in this.
The US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) ran a competition recently on the Internet for people to design UAVs, using crowd sourcing. There was an NTU team which participated in this competition. The competition was called “uavforge.net” and the NTU team submitted a UAV, participated in this and that entry was called “Extractor X”. There were 140 teams which competed in this competition from all over the world. Extractor X from Singapore got into the final 10 and eventually ranked six out of this 140. And I should tell you that amongst the people whom they came ahead of, one was from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the other one was from the Japanese Ministry of Defence. So I think that we did well.
One day when you fly SIA, you may fly a UAV. It will take some time but it is technically possible. What I am not so sure is possible is that you can have something replace a Singapore Girl and that I think the human touch will be there for some time to come. But UAVs are examples of robot technology, computers and artificial intelligence which are going to be pervasive. In healthcare too, we are going to see changes. A*STAR is doing research on brainwaves. Reading brainwaves, using your brain. Just by thinking you control a robot and here (referring to picture on screen) this person is using his brain, you see all the electrodes attached to his head, he is controlling the computer, the computer is controlling this arm (mechanical) which is moving his left arm. So if you can imagine if he is a stroke victim, this is something which can help him exercise, regain his strength or move for him, become like a bionic person.
How will these technological advances affect us? It is not just a “gee whiz” factor, cute to talk about. But it is going to cause the whole economy to change, entire industries to alter. Retailers are under pressure from online shops whether they are selling books, Amazon, whether they are selling videos. It is not even video delivered by mail but video comes down your broadband. Even groceries you can order, it will be delivered. No need for the shop, no need for the expensive rental space. Some jobs will disappear; others will have to be redesigned. Workers will have to be retrained, learn to use technology, how to raise productivity. You may be cleaning but you cannot just be sweeping the floor. You have to use a machine to do it better. You may be a personal secretary but your phone with Siri in a few years will be as smart as a personal secretary. The personal secretary will have to become an office manager to do other things which a phone cannot do. Our social norms will change, how we communicate with one another, how we interact with one another. It is going to transform Singapore in many ways which we can’t tell.
For this year’s National Day, we were or many of us were, at the floating platform on the bay. Some of us were overseas. There was one group in Melbourne. They gathered, they watched it live streaming on the Internet. Some of those kids, parents were at the Bay so we were having a remote joint celebration. They SMS-ed one another, you are watching the show here, they are watching the show there. You are enjoying it separated by 5000 miles. It’s a different world.
Within Singapore, domestic factors will change Singapore too over the next 20 years. Some of these you can already see – the more mature economy, an ageing society, a population which is better educated. But our future is not predetermined. It depends on ourselves, what we make of our resources, of education, our people, what we hope Singapore will be and what we will Singapore to become. What we decide, we want to be there, let’s get there. We have to set a clear direction. We cannot just be blown off course or drift with the tides onto the rocks. So I asked Heng Swee Keat to lead a national conversation on Our Singapore to define what sort of country we want and how we can achieve it. So please join in this national effort, think seriously about our future, contribute your ideas, work together to make it happen. In a rapidly changing world, Singapore must keep on improving because if we stand still, we’re going to fall behind. You may think you will be happy as you are, but when you see how the world has moved and what the human spirit is capable of elsewhere, we will not be happy. And even if we are, our children will not be happy. So we have to keep on moving and if we adapt to changes and exploit new opportunities, we will thrive.
So what should the next chapter of the Singapore story be about? I think if I summarise it very, very briefly, it should be about three words – Hope, Heart, Home.
We always have to offer hope of a better future in Singapore. An economy that creates opportunities for our people. A society that nurtures our people to their fullest potential. A people who look to the future and not just back to the past. A nation where our children will live better lives than us, as we did our parents.
We have done it in this generation, for this generation, with this generation. And it was brought home vividly to me recently in one MPS session when Mr Toh Phee Seng came to see me. He is a Teck Ghee resident. He works in the construction industry, he came to see me for some help because he needed to be recertified for the construction safety orientation course but he had a problem because he is illiterate. He cannot read English, he cannot read Chinese. He knows the safety rules, he can pass the exams but he needs somebody to read the exam for him, so could I please write him a letter? So I happily wrote him a letter then I had a chat with him and his wife after that and he told me proudly that his two children were graduates. The daughter, Huey Sun is an accountant with IRAS, this lady (pointing to the screen), and the son, Wei Seong, is an A*STAR researcher. He graduated from Singapore Poly, he went to university overseas. Eventually he earned a PhD from NUS, he was awarded an A*STAR international fellowship, he did a post-doc fellowship in Harvard and now he is back – research scientist, Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, I believe researching the structure of bones. So Mr Toh was happy that his children had done much better than himself. And his family reflects the experiences of so many other families in Singapore and epitomises Singapore’s transformation in one generation from Third World to First, from somebody illiterate, never had a chance to learn to read but brought up children who have been to Harvard, researchers, working, doing well. But beyond the broad lessons, I am sure you want to know what happened to Mr Toh’s MPS case. I got a reply from NTUC Learning Hub, which was a training provider. They have automated their process now so you don’t need somebody to read the questions for Mr Toh. They advised Mr Toh to take the computer-based audio exam so the computer will read the questions and Mr Toh can answer and I’m happy to say that Mr Toh passed the examination!
I know that our people sometimes worry about the future. Can our children really do better than us? But if we take a step back and look at where we are objectively and see our situation in perspective, I think the answer is: we are in much better shape than we give ourselves credit for. We have strong fundamentals. What do we mean? A world-class workforce, sound finances, a system that works. It is not perfect. Every now and then, something goes wrong and every time an MRT malfunctions, we are reminded of this but we can fix these imperfections and we can keep on making it better. We may be very conscious of our shortcomings but others have a high regard for what we have achieved. I met the former-President of MIT recently, Susan Hockfield. She was then about to retire and she was going on a visit to many countries in Asia. She came here, I knew her and I gave her dinner, and she told me how impressed she was with Singapore. She said Singapore is the only country where you can see the full potential of the human spirit. And this is a person, head of one of the top institutions in the world, the brightest. She has got people from all around the world, she has travelled, she tells me this completely unsolicited. I think we should give ourselves a little bit of credit. If we all work together and confidently tackle our problems, then I think we will improve our lives.
On jobs, we are bringing in many new investments. We are creating new and better jobs; in fact more jobs than we have persons to do them. We are strengthening the core of the workforce, the Singapore core of the workforce. We are offering new Singapore-Industry Scholarships for Singaporeans to go to university and work for local companies to build up our local companies. This year alone, 90 scholarships, and more to come. We are upgrading our low income workers – whether it’s cleaning, security industries or others. The opportunities are there, take advantage of them, upgrade yourselves to become more productive, to become more employable.
Public transport – I mentioned MRT just now – we are making major investments in trains, $60 billion over 10 years. Many lines coming on. Thomson Line work is going to start very soon. It goes from Woodlands to Marina Bay. The Downtown Line from Bukit Panjang to Changi Expo will open in phases starting next year. But train projects by their nature take time, major investments and you have to plan well ahead. So while we do the trains, we are also working on the Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP). It was a little bit controversial when we announced it in the Budget but it is a good thing, I think it is the right thing to do and will benefit many, many Singaporeans. And the commuters should start to see new buses, new services and better frequencies under the BSEP starting next month, progressively as we phase in the additional buses and as we hire and train the new drivers.
On ageing and healthcare, new hospitals are on the way. Ng Teng Fong Hospital in Jurong and the next one in Sengkang well under planning. We are building more nursing homes and daycare centres but on your part, please make the effort, keep fit, live healthily. It is the best and cheapest healthcare anyone can provide himself.
On housing, we are cutting the waiting time to book HDB flats and I am confident that nearly every Singaporean household can afford and can get their own home. We have done it before, we can continue to do it. There is enough space to accommodate the whole population even as it grows somewhat. We are developing more housing estates. In the longer term, we will reclaim more land and we are not just building flats but creating better living environments with green spaces, blue waters, clear skies. And with your help we are building stronger communities, communities where people live happily together, where people cooperate with one another. There is one thing I should mention on housing before I move on and that is the question of housing for singles. It is something which is on the minds of many Singaporeans because the numbers of singles have gone up. Singles can buy HDB flats on a resale market and get a Government grant, CPF grant, but they are not yet allowed to buy HDB flats directly from HDB. And I think this has caused some concern because resale prices have gone up. I fully understand these concerns and I should say MND also fully understands the situation and I would also say Khaw Boon Wan is looking actively at the matter.
Beyond these immediate challenges, we have to look ahead, prepare ourselves for the longer term. And the most important long term investment we can make is in our people and to make it through education. It is the key response to progress in technology and to the changing world. If you ask how do I cope with UAVs, with technology, with computers, with life sciences, with new processes and products? The answer is educate yourself for the new world. Learn to control the computers and robots, do not get replaced by them. We have got to keep upgrading ourselves, out-think and outsmart the competition and be smart enough to take advantage of the technology. And we have a good education system at all levels. Our universities produce graduates which are highly sought after, here and abroad. This picture (of a university graduation ceremony) was taken I think in this room. There are more graduation ceremonies than National Day Rallies held in this room every year. Our IT and poly students do brilliantly. They are considered world class institutions; nobody else has anything like that. They compete internationally, world skills competition, they win many medals. And the latest ones, hot off the press, is the FIRA World Cup, Robo Cup, this is not the FIFA World Cup, but this the Robot equivalent. Federation of International Robotic Associations. They had their competition in Bristol and yesterday was the finals and we came back, the Nanyang Poly team, 12 medals – seven gold, three silver, two bronze. There were two classes, bigger robots and smaller robots. So the large one, Evo Rocky won the overall gold, what did they get gold for? Sprint, weightlifting, penalty kick, lift and carry, marathon. But this picture is the smaller robot, he is called, his name is Red ATOM and he is the world record sprinter, three metres forward, three meters back, the robot has to run and broke the world record of 32 seconds and BBC reported on this and described him as a ‘Usain Bolt of robots’. Our school students also do well across the board and at the top they shine also at international competitions. This year our team won the International Biology Olympiad. We hosted it and we won, the team first place, and the International Mathematics Olympiad which I think was in Buenos Aires, a Singaporean Lim Jeck from NUS Math and Science School was the top student. He came in first, with full marks, the only one to score full marks this year, first time it has happened. But we are not just focusing on the best students. Yes, we ought to celebrate our gold medalists, our outstanding ones, but our schools and teachers are also doing their best for every student, from the weakest to the most talented ones and that is why we say every school is a good school, every neighborhood you have a good school. And this is not just a slogan, this is a reality. I received an email recently from one of my residents. I use my examples because I know them but the other MPs will surely have similar ones. This was from a father Mr Balu, his son Praveen is a Primary Six student in Townsville Primary School and he wrote me this. There is Balu and Praveen. (pointing to screen) He said “I am impressed by the openness and approachability of the teachers. Together with the guidance and motivation of dedicated teachers like Mdm Suhaizan and Mr Quek, my son performed much better in his mid-year exams. With such a dedicated team of educators, we are certain that my son will be much better prepared for his forthcoming PSLE”. So every school is a good school and if you look at this picture, it tells a story because they are posing in Townsville and I have been there and these pictures are not drawn by the teachers, they are drawn by the students because it is a niche area of excellence for Townsville Primary School. I can tell you that when I was in Primary Six, I couldn’t draw pictures like that and I still cannot. But today the opportunities are there and I think the results are showing.
Beyond school, we are opening up more paths in higher education. Singaporeans have very high aspirations, every parent wants his or her son to do as well as possible, go to university, and many ITE students hope to go on to the poly and most poly students aspire to get a degree one way or another, they want to get there. So we have been increasing our university places year by year for Singaporeans but still more Singaporeans want to go. So last year, I tasked Lawrence Wong to study this issue. And he concluded that we should create more university places and that we should focus on applied practice-oriented degrees. For example engineers, physiotherapists, social workers, skills which are useful, which are in demand, which will help to get the graduates jobs. We should not just churn out graduates regardless of the quality or the employment opportunities – set up the institutions, run the courses, print the degrees, produce the graduates, generate a lot of disappointment and unhappiness. Other countries have made this mistake, you produce unemployed graduates, underemployed graduates. Europe has got them, Britain, America, even China, many graduates come out looking for work, cannot find work. So we must avoid leading people up the wrong path, misleading them that if you spend three years of your life doing this, at the end you will have a happy outcome. We must make sure that if we let people go that way and encourage people to go that way, that at the end the prospects are good.
Right now we have two institutions that work closely with industry and emphasize practice oriented teaching. One is SIM University called UNISIM, which is a private institution and it runs part-time courses for adult students and it collaborates closely with the industry. For example it runs aerospace systems courses and the courses include a practicum, meaning the students have to spend a certain number of hours or weeks with a company in the industry, working in the company, learning about the practical aspects of aerospace engineering and they do the same with the social workers and the other courses. The other institution is SIT, the Singapore Institute of Technology, which has high quality foreign partners in focussed areas. For example one partner is DigiPen which is one of the top American institutions for interactive digital media and here you will see the student rendering something and the younger ones among you will know that this thing is called an AT-ST, Star Wars, All Terrain Scout Transport Walker. I confess I did not know, I had to learn but the young ones know and they are going to master this. SIT is partnering the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Science and engineering courses, here they are doing robots; I think this must be a robot soccer game. They are partnering the CIA, not the Central Intelligence Agency, but the Culinary Institute of America, learn culinary arts, again one of the top institutes and if you are going to be a chef or going to be running a restaurant, the CIA teaches you how to do it well. Here the students are learning from an American chef about pita bread. So SIT works with the foreign partners and the degrees are currently awarded by these foreign partners. So what will we do? We will increase the full-time places for applied degrees. We will make SIT and UniSIM our fifth and our sixth universities. SIT will expand and it will award degrees in its own name in addition to the partnerships it has. UniSIM will add full-time programmes to its part-time courses and it will build on its strong industry links but it will remain a private university. And that way we can increase the current full time university intake by a total of 3,000 students a year by 2020. In other words, today we take in 13,000 undergraduates a year, first year, by 2020 we will take in 16,000 students a year, 3,000 more and that would mean 40 per cent of each cohort will go to university, up from 27 per cent today and that would include more poly students and more JC students and I think that it will help to meet the aspirations of many Singaporeans.
That is for full time but at the same time, I think we should not forget the part time students, the adult students. UniSIM runs part time courses, I visited them recently, I was impressed with them, with their students too. Most of their students are in their late 20s or 30s, mostly poly graduates, gone out to work and decided to resume their studies while working. I chatted with some of them and I asked them why did you want to do this, take this path? They said well, when they left school or poly, they were not certain what they wanted to do, so they started work. After a few years of work, they knew the job market better, they knew themselves better, they had decided what they wanted to do with their lives, they resolved to enrol in UniSIM and start up again. Married with children, with jobs, but they have decided to do it and they were going to make it succeed. So I found them mature, clear in their own minds, what they wanted to do in their lives, determined to succeed, quite a different profile from young students who go straight to university and for whom all possibilities are still open. So it needs tremendous commitment and grit to succeed if you go to UniSIM and I think we should help people like that. Sometimes both husband and wife attend the course at the same time and I met one couple Alfred Toh and Natalie Chen who are both on course at the same time. Alfred Toh and Natalie Chen, Alfred is doing marketing, Natalie is doing visual comms. Midway through the course, Natalie got pregnant, so the course had to pause, the baby was born but when the baby was a little bit older, Alfred and Natalie resumed their course and now the baby is a toddler Zhi Xuan and Alfred and Natalie are about to graduate. So I think they deserve our congratulations. So this is a very good option for some segment of our students to leave school, go to work and then later on when you are clearer what you want to do, do something which is focused, practical and will help take your life aims forward. So we should give them more support. How? We will make more part time places available and secondly we will extend government bursaries and loans to UniSIM part-time students, so that they get the same support as part time students in NUS and NTU.
When I met the students, some of them asked me, can you allow us to take our CPF for education just like people can for the full-time courses? I said no, you are working, you have responsibilities, your CPF is for your house and your future, we will give you more support, I will prefer the government help you rather than you take from your CPF and I think with the bursaries and with the loans and with the scholarships, this will help those who have some financial difficulties to achieve their ambitions and their aspirations. MOE will announce the details later but I hope Singaporeans will take advantage of this, not just to collect a piece of paper but to develop yourselves, learn something useful, make a contribution to society.
At the other end of the education system, we also need to improve the quality of our preschool education. Once upon a time, education used to start when you went to school and entered Primary One or Standard One. My mother’s generation it was like that, about 90 years ago now, she only learnt to read when she went to school and it wasn’t because she was disadvantaged or deprived, it was the norm; that was how kids learnt. And she never felt any loss and she managed perfectly well in life. But when it came to my turn, she sent me at a young age to Nanyang kindergarten to learn Mandarin and that was 50 plus years ago, times had changed by then and times have changed even more now. Family structures have evolved, there are more nuclear families, just husband and wife and fewer children. More dual-income parents – so fewer opportunities for the kids to socialize at home with grandparents, with elder siblings, with cousins. We now know how important the early years are for children’s development. The brain is most receptive to learning certain things at that age especially languages, sounds, grammar, pronunciation. It is an age where kids can gain confidence and curiosity about the world around them – What is that? Let’s go and explore, let’s take a small risk, learn what is dangerous and what is not. It is also when kids should pick up positive behaviour, social skills and learning attitudes – when to queue up, take your turn, share. And so good preschool education will prepare students to enter Primary One and it will provide many long-term benefits later on in life whether in terms of your career stability, in terms of not getting into trouble with drugs, or with crime, in terms of your family’s stability when you get married. So today in Singapore, nearly 99 per cent, nearly all children, in fact more than 99 per cent of kids already attend preschool. There is a diverse mix of operators. Two key anchor operators, we call them AOPs, one is NTUC, the other one is PAP Community Foundation. They are the anchor operators, they have just under half of the total market and many different private providers as well. The government provides financial support to make preschool affordable. And we also provide support to the anchor operators to raise their standards. We have been doing this for several years, we are making progress but I think it is not enough and we have to do more. I think we have to substantially raise the quality of preschool education for children aged 5 and 6 years old especially the AOPs, the mass market anchor operators and at the same time we have to keep preschool affordable especially to the middle and lower income households because if you are going to raise standards considerably, it is going to mean more resources, higher costs, you are going to recruit more teachers, even better quality teachers, it is going to cost money and if you are going to do that, without raising the cost to their parents, and keeping it affordable, the government has to come in. Our objective is to level up all our students and make a positive difference to their development especially the students from the disadvantaged homes. So the government will invest substantial resources in preschool education and play a more active role.
First of all, we will establish a new statutory board to oversee preschool education. Secondly, we will provide and upgrade preschool teacher training to raise standards. Thirdly, we will bring in new anchor operators in addition to PCF and NTUC. Fourthly, we will upgrade the anchor operators, the existing ones as well as the new ones so that they can improve the careers which they can offer the teachers, they can offer structured development opportunities for the staff, they can introduce creative learning methods for the students but to raise the base, the quality of the mass market. Fifthly, we will pilot a few government run pre-school centres to test new concepts in kindergarten education. Finally, we will give more support to lower and middle income families so that it stays affordable. But we will not nationalize the pre-school sector. I read the debates in the newspapers over the last few months. Some people want the government to ‘pow ka liao’ (cover all bases). I think the government has a role to play but the government’s role is not to do everything. There’s a mix of operators and I think having a mix of operators offers diversity and choice. I think the choice is useful for parents because different parents will have different views, what their kids need and different kids will have different needs. So we should not deprive parents of this choice but instead we should raise the base, make sure that wherever you go, it is a good kindergarten. I have sketched out the broad outline but how exactly to do this, well, MOE and MCYS will follow up on the matter.
The transformation will take some time but I am confident that in five to seven years, we will be able to see results but I would like to offer one caution to parents: Please let your children have their childhood! Pre-school is to teach the kids certain skills which are best learnt at that age, language, social skills, basic motor skills. It is not meant for you to prepare with the Primary One, Primary Two textbook and to drill the kid at three or four years old so that by the time he goes to P1, he already knows what the teacher is supposed to teach him. Education experts, child development specialists, they warn against over teaching pre-school children. You do harm, you turn the kid off, you make his life miserable. Instead of growing up balanced and happy, he grows up narrow and neurotic. No homework is not a bad thing. It is good for young children to play and to learn through play. So please, I have heard of parents who sent their children to two kindergartens. I read of parents, who send their kindergarten age children to tuition, please do not do that.
Education is vital to the future of Singapore, to creating hope for a better tomorrow and hope is essential to our future and to the Singapore story. But besides hope, Singapore tomorrow must also have a bigger heart. Care and compassion for the needy and elderly, but also a largeness of spirit, a generosity, magnanimity to those who are around us. It reflects the sort of people we are and the values which we hold dear. We have for a long time recognized the importance of taking care of the less fortunate members of society. We have worked hard to build an inclusive society and enabled everyone to enjoy the fruits of progress, especially the weak and the elderly and the disabled, through housing, through education, through healthcare – heavily subsidized and widely available. But especially and more fundamentally through growth, prosperity which has created jobs and improved lives for all. Over the last decades, new needs have emerged. Society has become stretched out, somewhat stratified, we get pressure of globalization, so we have addressed these new social needs with new programs, Workfare, Comcare, additional housing grants, special housing grants, so many schemes, so many ways to help but the objective is targeted to uplift Singaporeans who need help. In this year’s Budget we made a major shift with an Inclusive Budget with significant initiatives for the elderly like the Silver Housing Bonus, for the low and middle income like the GST vouchers, for the disabled like daycare activity centres. We are not just spending more but we are setting a new strategic direction for Singapore and laying the basis for stronger social safety nets which will stand the test of the next couple of decades because we are striking a new balance in our social compact, what you must do as individuals, as families and what the state will help you to do so that we can advance together. What we have started in the budget we will build on in the years to come. But I would like as always to have a caution, have a care, three cautions. First, inclusiveness does not just mean more good things from the state or falling from heaven. All benefits have to be paid for. People say you are rich, you have reserves. We are already relying on reserves, spending part of the returns from investing these reserves. It is what Ministry of Finance calls NIRC, Net Investment Returns Contributions. It is an item in the budget. When you invest the money every year it grows, you take a bit of that growth or half of that growth and we use it for our spending. It has helped us fund many new programs and still balance our budget without having to push up taxes sharply. Last year FY 2011, from the reserves we got $8 billion to spend. We got more money from the reserves to spend than we got by collecting personal income taxes and I think it is four times as much as we got from COEs. It is not a small amount of money. It is one seventh of our expenditure every year, comes from our reserves. We are already drawing on this. If the reserves grow, you may get more. If the reserves do not, we will have to live with less. But we have to draw from the reserves in a sustainable way so that it stays there and you can continue to have money there year after year. We cannot just spend everything on ourselves. We have a responsibility to the future, to the next generation and we have to husband these reserves so that the next generation will not say my grandparents they spent it all.
If you look ahead, the state is bound to spend more on social services. We are ageing, medical science is progressing. Every year the demands will increase and these demands will have to be partially met from the state. Social spending will go up. In many countries the politicians champion social spending but they pretend it does not cost the taxpayers anything. Even in Singapore sometimes people tell you, does not matter, that is just a social investment. Since it is an investment it will look after itself. But let me tell you the truth, as our social spending increases significantly, sooner or later our taxes must go up. Not immediately but if you are talking about 20 years, certainly within that 20 years whoever is the government will at some point have to raise taxes because the spending will have to be done and the spending will have to be paid for and I hope that the government of the day will have the gumption to do that and the population of the day will have the good sense to support that. That is the first caveat. Nothing falls from heaven.
The second message is that social safety nets have to be coupled with self reliance and resilience. We have to want to do the best for ourselves. People have to be motivated to make the effort to strive, not just to queue up and get something from the state. The state will help you where it can but it cannot replace what you and your family can do for yourself and each other. To survive we have to be resilient, tough as individuals, close as families, cohesive as a society, strong as a nation. We have to be prepared to compete and to hold our own. The competition is there, there is no place to hide. The government can help to enable you to meet the competition. It is not possible for us to say we keep the competition away, there are big bad wolves who are outside, you are quite safe at home, nothing to worry about. Competition is there, we have to be tough enough. Sometimes, something will go wrong and when we encounter setbacks, we must have the spunk to pick ourselves up, dust off whatever stuck to us and press on.
The third caveat I have is we must maintain a sense of mutual responsibility amongst ourselves and especially on the part of those who are more successful than others. You have succeeded by working hard, through your own efforts, yes, but you have also benefitted from the system which nurtured you and from the many others who helped you to do well. President Obama in America said this recently. He got flamed because it got politicized. Obama said if you succeed, it is not because of yourself but this is exactly what he meant. You may be a great entrepreneur, you may be a very successful banker, you may have invented something but there were schools, there were parents, there were teachers, there was a society, there is a system which enabled you to do well. Without that you would have been nothing and I think our successful people have to know that and also have to feel that obligation that it is right that having done well, they make the effort and help others too.
One way to do this is by starting a social enterprise. One lady who started something is Josephine Ng who started a social enterprise called Alteration Initiative. Josephine used to run a marketing agency, did well but then she decided she wanted to do something more, sold it and to give back to society. She founded Alteration Initiative and what it does is to provide professional alteration services and the employees are women in need. She trains them as seamstresses, she gives them decent salaries and Alteration Initiative not just alters clothes but transforms their employees’ lives as well.
Besides social welfare, another aspect of having a big heart is very important and that is: knowing how to treat one another on this little island of ours. We have built a harmonious society by being big hearted. We treat our fellow citizens with respect. We accommodate the practices and the beliefs and the customs of different races and religions. We share our void decks for Malay weddings, Chinese funerals, other ceremonies, there is a spirit of give and take, mutual accommodation. We are all in this same country together and indeed I think most Singaporeans are generous by nature. You read many heartwarming stories and thank you letters in the Straits Times Forum. Taxi driver returns a handbag left in his taxi, old lady fell down, stranger came, picked her up, helped her cross the road, go home. These are all ways which we ought to be behaving and acting. More people are donating to charitable causes. Young people particularly are passionate over causes beyond themselves. I met a bunch of youth leaders recently over tea and I was very cheered by the experience just as you heard Lawrence Wong talk about it earlier because they were engaged, they were positive, they were doing something about it, not just talking about it and they could see how their efforts were making society better. One of them was Tok Kheng Leng. She is a youth volunteer and she leads overseas youth expeditions. She topped her class in Ngee Ann Poly. Now she is pursuing a social work degree in NUS and I think she will make an outstanding social worker because her passion is there. Farhan Firdaus, another active youth volunteer. He founded Voluntarius which is an organisation which brings youths together to do good work, for example, cycling to raise money for disadvantaged kids and there are many more stories like that.
But I would be less than honest if I did not tell you that there are also some troubling signs which we can all see. Residents reserving public roads outside their houses to park their own cars. They do not use tissue paper, they use dust bins, they use flower pots and then they use dust bins and flower pots to fight one another once in a while. HDB neighbours on the same corridor quarrelling over the washing of the corridor. One wants it clean, the other wants it dry, no end of arguments. Placing of potted plants, arguments over noise – one says he is practising his singing, the other one say you are disturbing my child’s examination preparations. It becomes a feud. The RCs have a big headache because they are friends with both but they cannot make the problem go away. People objecting to nursing homes and studio apartments in their own place but please put it just across the road so it is not too far away. These are not new things, it is still only a minority but we seem to be getting less patient, less tolerant, less willing to compromise in order to get along. Maybe it is because we are losing the kampong spirit. We talked about the kampong spirit, we think back to the picture just now which I showed in my Chinese speech of how the kampong was. All the kids big and small gathered around the well. You are not just collecting water or washing clothes or bathing but you are interacting with one another and therefore getting along with one another. When we moved into HDB flats, some of that remained, you had the common corridors, people leave the doors open, talked to one another. There are common spaces. You may wait for the lift and in the old days you wait quite long for the lift because one lift on three floors, no LUP yet. One way or another you interact with your neighbours and you become friends and so there is give and take. But today we lead more private lives. The corridors, many of them are not common corridors, three, four flats share one lift landing. LUP, now you do not have to go downstairs and meet and people from three levels, just people on your floor. Work takes more time. There are fewer opportunities to bump into neighbours. Unconsciously less interaction results in less consideration, maybe more self-centred behavior and maybe that explains why there is a rising trend of not so good behavior. But we should not less this spread and make us into ugly Singaporeans. I think we will be ashamed of ourselves. We should do our best to be big hearted, to our neighbours to our fellow citizens, in fact to our fellow human beings. It is not just a matter of courtesy. It goes much deeper than that. It reflects how unselfish we are, how much we respect other people.
There is one particularly difficult area where we need to be big hearted and that is in relations between Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans. I think most Singaporeans understand the need for immigrants for foreign workers and accept them but many Singaporeans have concerns because the influx has caused some real problems and I completely understand this and I think it is fair enough for people to express concern or to disagree with our immigration trends or oppose our immigration policy. That is part of the democratic debate. But I am worried by some of the nasty views which are expressed, especially online and especially anonymously, which brings out the worst in people. When the foreigners say or do something wrong, especially to Singaporeans, the response is overwhelming. But when a Singaporean does something wrong, which I think we all have to admit once in a while does happen, very often the behaviour is un-criticised. And when a foreigner does a good deed, very often that goes unnoticed. I give you some examples from the Internet. Sun Xu became famous, NUS student, made an angry blog post, offensive, he was roundly and rightly chastised and punished by NUS. But if you go online, you will find many nasty posts by Singaporeans about foreigners. In fact, there are some websites which specialise in tormenting and berating certain groups of foreigners from certain countries. Very few people stand up to say that this is wrong, this is shameful, we repudiate that. I think that’s no good. You look at incidents on buses. The Straits Times published one letter recently about foreigners on a bus, the foreigners who made a difference because a woman, an old woman got sick on the bus, threw up, dirty, smelly, the other passengers all shied away. This foreign nurse came forward, cleaned her up, helped her, took her off the bus, was the only one who responded. So somebody wrote this in the forum page. There was no video, there was no Youtube (video), there was no Internet response whatsoever. On the other hand, when two women quarrelled over a bus seat, you know which Youtube video I am talking about. The non-Singaporean behaved and screamed outrageously, the Singaporean sat there, her video went viral. So I think this as the Taiwanese author says 独眼龙 “one-eyed dragon”. We cannot afford to be one-eyed dragons. It reflects badly on us, it damages our international reputation. People think that Singapore is anti-foreigner, xenophobic. New York Times carried an article, very powerful headline “In Singapore, Vitriol Against Chinese Newcomers”. Other newspapers carry stories too. Herald Tribune carried the same story, softer headline. Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, even Xinhua carried stories. It does not do us good. But more fundamentally than that, apart from our reputation, it speaks poorly of what sort of people we are. I mean, what sort of people do we want to be? We need to be people who are proud of ourselves, who have a heart, who can feel for other fellow human beings, who will be courteous, respectful and behave with others as we would like others to behave to us. It is not my job to give a lecture or a sermon, this is a speech. But I have to point this out, this is my duty. There will social frictions from time to time, it is unavoidable. There will be non-Singaporeans who will behave badly. They may post something offensive, they may behave badly towards neighbours, they may offend people of other races because they are insensitive. They do not know what the norms are and ditto, from time to time, there will be Singaporeans who do that too. And unfortunately, technology is one of the things which has made this worse because with smart phones and social media, it is easier to give offence and it is easier to take offence. You cannot pretend you did not see and even if you think nobody saw, somebody may have filmed it. So we should deal with these incidents maturely. It is all right to express disapproval of what has happened, it is necessary even. It is not alright to be a one-eyed dragon or to condemn all non-Singaporeans or all Singaporeans based on the actions of a few bad apples. Also, it is wrong to slam the shortcomings of others but ignore our own transgressions. So we have to work on this from both sides. Singaporeans have to show a generosity of spirit to one another, including to the new arrivals. And the new arrivals also have to make the effort to embrace our values, to commit themselves to Singapore and to integrate into our community. We will welcome into our midst, into our family but you must make the effort too. There are success stories in integration. Many immigrants from the PRCs serve in the grassroots or do charity work. Many Indian PRs volunteer as youth mentors in SINDA, help little kids to read, to have other activities outside school which are meaningful. I was told of one German PR married to a Singaporean who shops at Tekka Market, makes his own sambal and loves durians so I think he qualifies as an honorary Singaporean. But one story in particular caught my eye and it is of a Vietnamese girl called Le Ha Thanh Mai who is here today. She came to Singapore when she was 15 years old, did not speak English, on a scholarship, she went to school, she had difficulty adjusting because of language but also because school was taught differently here and in Vietnam. But she went on to Temasek JC, things improved. Her classmates welcomed her, helped her to integrate. By the time she went to SMU, she was so localised that if you did not know her name, you would not know she came from somewhere else. So her fellow students elected to become the international student secretary of the SMU Students Association and her job was to lead efforts to encourage other international students to integrate with the locals and to learn more about one another’s cultures. So here she is, this is not quite our culture but nevertheless here is Le Ha Thanh Mai in the middle jumping highest of all. So I read you what she wrote in reflection of her experience here. “I feel as much as a Singaporeans as I am a Vietnamese. I have come to love the hawker food, the Singapore River that I jogged along, the fireworks every National Day on the magnificent background of Singapore skyline, the shopping malls a few streets down the road, the cinemas where I spent many nights watching movies, the schools I attend and most importantly, the friendships I have made”. The friendships I have made.
So it is ultimately up to us how big-hearted how we want to be. We may be a small island, we cannot be small-minded. We cannot just be a prosperous and successful country. We have also got to be a caring, a generous, a decent people; people who are gracious and warm towards one another as well as towards others and that is the best way to ensure that tomorrow Singapore will have a bigger heart.
Besides hope and heart, Singapore must always be our best home, a place where we feel that we belong, where we show our loyalty to our country, where we take pride in what we have achieved together and what we stand for. A home we love, which is the theme for this year’s NDP. Families are a big part of what home means because families are central to our sense of who we are. You are not the job you do but you are a papa or mama or daughter or granddaughter or cousin, these are the links which are the closest. Families give us the reason to defend and protect what we have and when we say set up home, we mean settle down, have kids, bring up a family. And therefore, Singapore has to be a home where people want to get married, want to have children, want to bring up the next generation. But alas, we are having too few babies. I will show you the TFR chart. This is replacement level, 2.1 total fertility rate which means every woman produces 2.1 kids, replaces herself, her husband and a little bit to spare. But if you look at actually what we have been able to do from 1975 onwards, we started off there, around 2.1 but the trend has been steadily down ever since, coming down to about 1.2 last year and all the way down. There are ups and downs from year to year, the red years are 12 years apart, ’76, ’88, ’00 and ’12, but I cannot imagine the ‘12 being here (pointing to a TFR higher than in 2000) and therefore, we have a problem. The long term trend is down but we cannot give up, we have got to do something about it. And when people ask me, which many visitors do, what problems do you have in Singapore, I offer them this one as an example of one not easy to solve and they give me their ideas, sometimes serious, sometimes not. One Asian politician said why do you not have more blackouts? He has blackouts, he has high TFRs, does not mean I have blackouts, I will have high TFR. It is not so simple. More Singaporeans remain single or they are getting married later. Part of the reason is working too long hours and I am saying this quite seriously, I think being connected 24/7 is marvelous but having email round the clock is not an entirely good thing. Married couples are having fewer children, on average now each married woman has two kids. Previously it was more, so this number has also been coming down. So they are replacing mom and dad but they are not making up for those who are not marrying and having children and 20-30 plus per cent now are not marrying, not having children. So we have a problem.
Many Singaporeans have explained their considerations and their concerns, when to get married, when to have kids. And I have talked to some of them, recently I talked to one young lady, a teacher, she has four kids, young ones from the age 14 to the age of one, and she has gone back to work as a teacher and she appreciates the schemes we have for working mothers, paid maternity leave, flexi-work arrangements and so on but she says but if I took all these schemes, then I am pushing my load onto my colleagues, other teachers and furthermore when it comes to assessment time, my head of department and my principal will not know what grade to give me. So even if you are giving me more of these leaves and perks, it will not help me with my career which was important to her. So I asked her what is the one thing that would encourage Singaporeans to have children and she said “work-life balance” but then she added “but that is not in your power to give”. She understands. We want work-life balance, we encourage people to have work-life balance, but finally it is the attitudes of the employers, it is the attitudes of the individuals who are pursuing their careers, it is a social norm, everybody is working, so I feel I have to work long hours too and so we are stuck in that position. I talked to another young couple. They are volunteers in my branch and when I have MPS, the husband is there till past midnight. They are newly married, moved into a HDB flat in Sengkang, not ready for children yet, even though the flat has already arrived. So I asked them what are your considerations? I want to understand how you see these choices before you. What would help? The husband said you should make childcare more accessible, you should offer more flexible work arrangements. The wife had a slightly different take, also very sensible, and she said I don’t want six months maternity leave, my boss might forget about me, but if you can have paternity leave and fathers can help to bring up the children, that would be helpful. So these are sensible views of young Singaporeans and I am sure they are shared by many other couples.
So what more can we do? NPTD is studying this very carefully as part of the population issue, they are consulting widely and we will work out a package which we hope will be ready by the time our White Paper is published around January but meanwhile tonight I will just share with you some broad ideas which take in some of the views which we have received so far and the idea is to address the issues which make a difference to the couples either substantively or to point a signal that this is something which is important, please think about it and please try to change our mindsets and our norms and behaviours.
So first work-life balance, I think we need to do more to promote flexible work arrangements and we can help to help employers to go in this direction. We also have to improve work culture and employer attitudes so that you have certain new norms which are set and maybe we should take seriously the idea of having one day a week when you close shop at six o’clock and if you are seen in the office after that, then that is a minus for promotion purposes!
Housing – in other countries, you get married, you have kids, and then eventually you save up, you buy a house. In Singapore, it is the other way round. House first, then you think about marriage, then you think about kids. I think now that housing is off the boil and we have built more flats, many more flats in the pipeline, I think that we should give some consideration to giving couples with young kids priority when they book HDB flats. Firstly it will solve their problem faster, secondly it may encourage them to have a kid so that the flat will come faster. Thirdly, at birth, this question of leave, I think maternity leave at 16 weeks is about all right, you can make it longer but employers have serious worries and we should take them seriously and I think employees have worries too but this idea of paternity leave in some form, either you give some to the husband or you make some of the maternity leave convertible, we have said no for a very long time, but I think it is time we change. To signal the importance of the father’s role and your shared responsibility for raising the children, so please use the paternity leave for the purpose it is given. Fourthly, medical, one of the worries which couples have when they bring up a kid is what if something is wrong and the medical expenses, how are we going to meet that? So one idea is we create a Medisave account for each kid when it is born, when he or she is born and we put a small hongbao in for him to start life and you can defray the childhood medical expenses and reassure the parents, no need to worry and that part is seen to. Another thing we can do is preschool which I have talked earlier about the steps we are going to do to raise standards, to make it affordable, to put a lot more resources in, I think that would be helpful but other than preschool, there is also childcare and infant care and we should give more financial support to low and middle income households for childcare and infant care. And as for the places where these are going to go, we need some in the housing estates near homes, I think we need some near workplaces, and we should help the operators who set up the centers in the housing estates or near the workplaces and I hope that if one comes to a block of flats near you, you will welcome it even if you have no longer young children.
Finally, we can always improve the baby bonus, it is always welcome. We can look at that but I do not think money is the point. It is ultimately not about money, it is about values, it is about deep motivations. Singaporeans will marry and have children because of the fulfillment that having a family brings and the measures as I have said are to address the practical problems and to point the direction to signal the changes we would like to see in the mindsets. Beyond these specific packages, we need to create the right environment, the right social environment, the right ethos so that Singaporeans want to settle down and have kids and strengthen that sense that this is home, here is where we want to raise our families.
Besides families, memories of places of old friends, of events we have lived through are also essential to keeping Singapore our best home. It is often the simple things in life which remind us most of home. I was reminded of this recently when I got another email from the public, a young lady called Thecla Loh who wrote to me to wish me Happy National Day and she shared with me something she had written which I liked and I would like to share with you too. I quote a little bit of what she wrote. She said “it is the simple things which I love about my country like waking up on a Saturday morning, feeling the chill in the morning air, deciding to go downstairs to have a warm bowl of duck porridge instead of the usual cold cereal, having freshly fried piping hot you zha gui with ice cold soya milk on a whim” – my mouth is watering already – “having an elderly lady in a wheelchair pull up beside me mistaking me for one of her kopi kakis and discussing the weather with me in Hokkien, watching the Indonesian maid speak fluent Hokkien to her elderly wheelchair bound employer and showing genuine concern and care for the old lady, reminding me of my grandmother and her Indonesian helper whom I am truly grateful for for helping to take care of the needs of my grandmother in her last years.” So it is the family, an extended family and even the Indonesian maid is part of this extended family. Thecla remembers Singapore by the food, the people, most importantly by the family and so too with all of us and with me. Home, the house where you grow up, the family you grew up with, the times when you were young and this picture which I discovered recently and had not seen before taken in May 1965 has all of that, 38 Oxley Road, parents, siblings and also the dog. But over the years, more links formed, more memories accumulate. To me home means other things as well, memories of places, places you have known over the years for many years which have changed and when you see it, it is playing a video replayed. You scroll back in your mind’s eye and you imagine it as it used to be. Nanyang Primary School, today handsome new buildings, young generation of excited students. When I went to kindergarten this is what it looked like and this is what I still imagine it to be. Here is the old school hall, the 礼堂 (school hall) and our kindergarten was inside there, no computers, no complicated play equipment, just one class in each corner cordoned off and one piano. That was then. I drive down Orchard Road, swank shopping places, strange new buildings. This is Orchard Central. I think back to the old Orchard Road car park. The younger generation may not know but once upon a time this was where the best hawker food in town was to be found. The “ou luak” (oyster omelette) has never been better! You go down Bras Bash Road. Today SMU, beautiful gracious buildings, trees, students there maybe with boyfriends and girlfriends studying, reflecting pools, modern Singapore, but I think back when I was a student, the SJI school field. I was not from SJI but Catholic High next door had no school field so we borrowed this one. Sports Day, band marching, practising this is where we went. These were the haunts where we grew up.
Marina Bay, today a special skyline recognized the world over but when I see it I wind back to this. It was not even land, was sea. Collyer Quay and you go out. I used to take a boat and go out and we go past this long you see this thing here it was a breakwater. If you are old enough you will remember. You go past the breakwater which protected the harbor out to southern islands, St John’s Island, where I would go with my parents, my father was visiting political detainees. That is then and today it has become an icon like this. And it is not complete because we will continue to build and improve and in five, 10 years’ time you have something even better. So places add another layer of home. People are a part of home, you meet old friends, old comrades, people you serve with in the SAF. Happens to me not infrequently, served together years ago and you come across them and it is always heartwarming when they say to you, “Evening Sir, I am your solder, we served together”. Recently it happened to me, I was going around the tables at an Iftar in Teck Ghee and the Malay gentleman stood up and said “Hello I am Omar”. I looked at him and my mind went back 40 years, 1975 Taman Jurong Camp, Corporal Omar, my vehicle electrician. 40 years have passed, he is happy, he is well, he is here, we rejoiced. We were both so happy, I took this picture of us together on the iPhone. His son is now a cardiologist, so his story is like Mr Toh Phee Seng. When you are overseas you get a warm feeling when citizens greet you. People come up and say “Hello Mr Lee, I am from Singapore too”. Happened to me recently. I and my wife were on holiday in Dalat, Vietnam, last December. We were quietly having breakfast in a restaurant. Two young ladies came over to ask me to take a picture with them. So we did and she said I am from Teck Ghee Primary School, I am one of the teachers there. You can see my breakfast is still here. I came out from breakfast, there was a group of Singaporeans there “李先生拍照，我们是宏茂桥来的！” (Mr Lee, please take a picture with us, we are from Ang Mo Kio too) They are proud to be Singaporeans, extended family on a trip. They are proud of Singaporean and they make me feel proud to be Singaporean.
Events are part of home. I remember 9th of August 1965 when it happened, 1966 our first parade. Nothing to march with except some national flags and coloured flags, then more variety, more equipment, helicopters, the national anthem and you especially remember the moments when the flag flies past and you sing Majulah Singapura. The helicopter changes from UH-1H, it went to the Super Puma, now we have a Chinook. We are now on a floating platform but when you sing Majulah Singapura the pride and emotion are the same.
All of us have our own memories and stories to tell and therefore the Singapore Memories Project, 300,000 memories so far, still collecting. I have shared many people’s memories today. Toh Phee Seng and his family giving his children the education he himself never had. Chung Win Kee, discovering a whole new world online and improving his chicken rice recipe along the way. Madam Chang Ka Fong, 87 years young, still playing basketball daily. Iskandar Jalil, creating beautiful pottery displayed all over the world. I have also shared with you about younger ones, their lives ahead of them who will write the next chapter of our story and build their own treasure house of memories. Joshua Chao and the Extractor X Team making new breakthroughs to transform our lives. Jauhari and Adil Hakeem, inspiring young Singaporeans to do their best. Praveen and his teachers, preparing for a brave new world. Thecla, discovering new things to love about Singapore. Alfred and Natalie, graduating from UniSIM, raising Zhi Xuan to be a proud and patriotic Singaporean.
These memories come together to define the Singapore story for all of us. Individually these are our life experiences, collectively these bind together to become the soul of the nation. We must cherish them and build upon them. In our shared future the world may be completely different, our lives may be quite transformed but our drive to keep the Singapore story vital and fresh for all of us must never falter.
Let’s work together to create a better Singapore, where we look to our shared future with confidence and hope, where we treat one another and others too with a big heart, where we build for children and grandchildren our best home. Goodnight!

   singaporewebsite update april",12328,"In his speech, the speaker outlines Singapore's vision and developmental strategies for the next 20 years, emphasizing the need for adaptability in a rapidly changing global landscape. He highlights the potential challenges and opportunities presented by the rise of major Asian economies like China and India, and the technological advancements that are transforming industries and everyday lives.

The speaker stresses the importance of maintaining Singapore's competitiveness by comparing its progress not only with other countries but also with major cities globally. He underscores the dual role of Singapore as both a country and a city, which necessitates a unique approach to development and international competition.

A significant portion of the speech is dedicated to technological advancements, particularly in information technology and robotics, which are expected to revolutionize sectors such as defense, healthcare, and retail. The speaker provides examples of local innovations and achievements in technology, suggesting that these areas will be crucial for Singapore's future economic transformation.

The speech also addresses domestic challenges such as aging demographics, the need for enhanced social safety nets, and the importance of fostering a sense of community and national identity. The speaker calls for a national conversation to redefine Singapore's values and aspirations, ensuring that future policies align with the citizens' vision for their country.

Overall, the speech sets a proactive and forward-looking agenda for Singapore, focusing on technological innovation, economic competitiveness, and social cohesion as key pillars for the nation's continued success and stability in the face of global changes."

* * * * *
Good evening again. I hope you have enjoyed taking a look at the campus and meeting the students here at ITE College Central. I brought the Rally to ITE for a serious purpose – to underscore my longstanding commitment to investing in every person, every Singaporean, to his full potential. And also to signal a change, to emphasise that this is not the usual NDR. Singapore is at a turning point. Tonight, I will talk about the challenges which we face and what we must do to change to respond to these challenges in this new phase of our development and nation-building.
Last year, I spoke about these essential elements of our future, “Hope, Heart and Home”. Since then, we have been holding Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) on building a better Singapore. The OSC took a fresh approach to engage Singaporeans. They had no pre-set agenda, it was a fully open discussion and it elicited a very positive response. Nearly 50,000 people participated, and diverse groups. We had elderly residents meeting at the Yuhua Hawker Centre. Grace Fu brought them in and they had the discussion in dialects. I think they had the time of their lives and also appreciated being heard. We had the arts and the culture community expressing their point of view. We had schoolchildren drawing pictures of what they aspired to see when they grew up one day. They shared what Heart, Hope and Home meant to them.
They also expressed what they wanted to see in Singapore. First of all, opportunities - opportunities to lead fulfilling lives, to realise one’s potential. Secondly, purpose - coming together to build a better Singapore. Thirdly, assurance - assurance that our basic needs can be met, that we do not have to face life’s uncertainties alone. Fourth, community spirit - closer community ties, stronger social cohesion, a warmer kampong spirit. And finally and fifthly, trust - trust between the Government and people, trust among Singaporeans. And these themes were summarised in the OSC exhibition which I hope you had a look at outside this auditorium. I had tea recently with the OSC Committee members, the facilitators, the volunteers, to thank them for what they were doing and I asked them what was their biggest takeaway from this exercise. They said, the spirit of openness. Participants realising that others had different, even conflicting views and that these views had to be reconciled, respected and we had to find a way forward, consensus where possible, sometimes agree to disagree. So the OSC has been a very meaningful exercise. We have listened to one another, we have created a firmer, shared basis to discuss and to plan our future and I would like to thank the OSC Committee members, the facilitators, the volunteers and the participants for all the work which they have done. Thank you very much.
To achieve our aspirations, we need to take into account the world around us. This is a time of rapid change and uncertainty. I have discussed these themes before many times, so tonight, I would just like to briefly share with you a few striking facts about technology, about globalisation, about competition and income inequalities. Technology is transforming our lives. Even tonight as I am talking to you, more than a few of you are taking pictures, tweeting, Facebooking and Instagramming in real time. But it is not just social media. We have 3D printing, a machine which can print spare parts, print models, print toys, print pistols, print body parts, organs; print things which can make a difference to our lives. Medical devices - we have been doing this research. A*STAR has a 3D printer which can print Bone Tissue Scaffolds and let me show you this picture. (Pointing to slides) This is a printer behind, this is the monitor and you can see the thing which it is printing. It looks like a little rectangle with two holes in it. Those are the Bone Tissue Scaffolds. What do you use it for? If you have a tooth extraction, after the dentist has taken a tooth out, you have a hole in your gum, you put this in, it helps the bone to grow back. And you can see this one is about to come in and on the left you can see there is one already done. A bionic person is some distance off yet but we are heading in that direction. Less spectacular but equally far-reaching are robots, Artificial Intelligence, programmes which can do smart things which previously only human beings could do. Not just placing chips on the production line but skilled, professional jobs - accounting, legal advice, radiology, reading X-rays. In the old days, each one was a professional job. You needed a lawyer, highly paid, or a doctor or an accountant. Now the basic work can be delegated to a computer programme. Liberating for us, a bit scary if you were doing that job before, but that is competition.
Competition from technology, competition also from new emerging economies - China, India, Vietnam. China and India alone have one billion workers altogether. Every year, millions of new graduates are entering the workforce. Just now in the Mandarin speech, I said seven million (per year) from China. If we add in some more from India, it is ten million a year, all hungry, looking for work. Quite formidable. One of our young professionals who took part in an OSC dialogue in Shanghai said, “I thought I could survive in China quite easily but I was wrong”. He had to scramble, but fortunately other OSC participants said that learning Mandarin in Singapore had helped them in China. They may not have enjoyed it in school or PSLE but now that they are working, they appreciated its value and they are grateful we forced them to do it. So we are seeing competition and we are seeing income inequality rising, the top zooming away, middle class stagnating. People with exceptional skills, globally in demand doing very well, not just IT or financial services, but even culture or sports. Take Ronaldo, the footballer. He visited a secondary school last month, Crest Secondary School in Singapore. He got mobbed! He has many fans in Singapore. If you go to his Facebook page, 60 million Facebook fans; 20 million Twitter followers. In Chinese they say da wu jian xiao wu (小巫见大巫), a little kucing kurap looking at this mega star. Therefore, spectacularly successful; but not everybody else can be as talented or as lucky as Ronaldo. So people have to work a lot harder, may not be earning a lot more but enjoying less job security than before.
So Singaporeans are affected by these global trends and feeling uncertain and anxious also because in Singapore too, technology and globalisation are widening our income gaps and in addition to that, we have domestic social stresses building. Our population is ageing, society becoming more stratified, less mobile, children of successful Singaporeans more likely to do well. Children of lower income families, fewer of them rising than in previous generations. It is a reality and we acknowledge it; we have to do our best to do something about it. These trends are compounded by day-to-day problems – cost of living, public transport, you know them as well as I do. So Singaporeans sense correctly that the country is at a turning point. I understand your concerns. I promise you, you will not be facing these challenges alone because we are all in this together. We will find a new way to thrive in this new environment.
My colleagues and I have been pondering these problems over the past year, thinking hard about them. What principles have worked for Singapore? What changes do we have to make, how can we continue to thrive and prosper? The OSC process and reflections have given us valuable inputs into this. They have expressed Singaporeans’ views and feelings on where we stand and what we want Singapore to be and it has given us confidence to set out a new way forward.
We must now make a strategic shift in our approach to nation-building. Singapore has been built on three pillars - the individual, the community and the state – and each has played a role complementing one another. The individual working hard, saving for himself and his family. The community getting together to help different groups of people, whether it is a union, whether it is VWOs, whether it is business federations, the clans, each group coming together strengthening one another. And overall, the Government creating the conditions for a vibrant economy and for good jobs, investing heavily in our people through education, through housing, through healthcare but keeping state welfare low and targeted, stringent. Some people call this tough love but it is tough love which has worked well.
Today, the situation has changed. If we rely too heavily on the individual, their efforts alone will not be enough, especially among the vulnerable like the low-income families, like the elderly. And there are some things which individuals cannot do on their own and there are other things which we can do much better together. So we must shift the balance. The community and the Government will have to do more to support individuals. The community can and must take more initiative, organising and mobilising ourselves, solving problems, getting things done. We have to be a “democracy of deeds and not a democracy of words”, as Mr S. Rajaratnam who was one of our founding fathers, said many years ago.
The Government will also do more to support individuals and the community. What we used to do we will continue to do, to provide core public services, housing, education, healthcare. But at the same time we will make three important shifts in our approach. First, we will do more to give every citizen a fair share in the nation’s success, raise the incomes and the wealth of the low-income Singaporeans. For example, through our housing programme: home ownership.
Secondly, strengthen social safety nets. Assure people that whatever happens to you, you can get the essential social services that you need, especially healthcare. Thirdly, do more to keep paths upwards open for all; to keep our society mobile, to bring every child to a good starting point and make sure that whichever family you are born to, whether you are privileged or not privileged, you are never shut out from the system, from opportunities and especially through education. These are three strategic shifts. One, to level up people; two, to share the risks, to make sure that whatever happens in life, you will not be alone and three, to keep our system open, mobile, so that if you have talent you can rise, if you work hard, you can get ahead. We will apply these shifts progressively to all our social policies. And let me tonight talk about housing and healthcare and education specifically, add a little bit more detail, so that you understand what we are trying to do.
Singapore has succeeded because everyone has shared in the fruits of our progress. Incomes have risen across the board. The values of homes has appreciated and even poor people are not poor by any international standard. If you take the lowest one-fifth of our households by income, the lowest one-fifth, 20 per cent of households, that means about 200,000 households; each household in this group, each poor household has on average $200,000 of net wealth in the HDB flat. What does that mean? The household owns a flat, it may be fully paid, it may be not fully paid. If it is not fully paid, you subtract out the mortgage which is outstanding, what is in his name, is his. On average, $200,000 per household. No other society in the world has done that. We have achieved in Singapore growth with equity and spread the fruits of growth widely in Singapore. But today maintaining equity has become harder, because income distributions have widened. We are not all Ronaldos. But we do have a few who can do almost as well as Ronaldos and others along that spectrum. So, the Government must intervene more to keep ours a fair and a just society.
In fact we have been doing this already in recent years. It is not starting tomorrow; it has started in recent years. Workfare was a big first move. We have got permanent GST vouchers. We have got the Special Employment Credit. Each one of these schemes institutionalised, building blocks of a more active social policy. And we will build on these programmes to give those with less a better deal so long as you too make the effort, give of your best.
Housing has and will continue to be an important way to share the fruits of our progress with all Singaporeans and to level up the poor. The HDB programme is not just about the roof over our heads. It is also a valuable nest egg. But it is not just a valuable nest egg. It is also a home, a home where we sink roots, where we raise families, where we build ties, friendships, emotional ties with our fellow Singaporeans. And you can see this in any community anywhere in Singapore. But I give you as an example, my Teck Ghee residents. Look at this gentleman, Mr Ho Tee Soon. He was a sailor all his life. He came back to Ang Mo Kio, settled down in 1978, and raised his family there. Four children, nine grandchildren, now he even has six great-grandchildren. He has got friends, he has got family, he has got neighbours, he chit-chats with his friends on his void deck daily. And take a guess, how old he is? He is 104! Or take Madam Puranam. She has lived in Teck Ghee more than 25 years. She sells Indian spices at the Block 409 market and her regular customers are her good friends.
So, we want to help Singaporeans own their homes, raise loving families and build strong communities. Therefore, I believe that home ownership is still a fundamental principle for Singapore. We can talk about rentals, we need some. We can talk about other models we may experiment, but the core of it, home ownership. 99-year lease, it is yours.
In the last two years we have moved decisively to do more to help Singaporeans to own their homes. We have built a record number of new flats, cleared the first-timer backlog. We have delinked new flat prices from the resale market and stabilised BTO prices. We have introduced a Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG), targeted for poorer households to buy two-room flats, three-room flats. We have raised the income ceilings and relieved the sandwiched class. And we have allowed singles to buy BTO flats, something which they have asked for, for a very long time. And we introduced the NS Recognition Award – NSRA – for NS men. It is a hongbao paid into the CPF accounts of the NSmen, which NSmen can use to buy a flat, some of it. So all of these things have made flats more affordable and more accessible.
We will always make sure that an HDB flat is always within reach, affordable and available to Singaporeans.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
But I know that Singaporeans still worry about property prices. We do surveys and it is one of the items on their minds, (along) with healthcare. They ask themselves - if they are young - can I afford a flat when I get married? If you are older - can my children afford to get married? Because no flat cannot get married, or as they say in Singapore, ‘cannot ROM’. They ask, what if I lose my job before I finish paying off my flat, paying off my housing loan? And so in the OSC conversations, Singaporeans wanted “Home First, Then Asset”. Ideally of course, you want the home, you want the asset, you want it all. One lady, a mother at a dialogue expressed this. She said she hoped her property would appreciate because it is hers and she wanted to keep its value, but then at the same time she wanted her kids to have cheaper housing. And then she laughed because she knew that you cannot really have both. You must decide which it is going to be. So we cannot deliver everything this mother is hoping for but we can maintain the value of HDB flats over the years, provided Singapore remains stable and strong. At the same time, we can keep the flats affordable for future flat buyers. And I will make sure that every Singaporean family who is working can afford an HDB flat. We can do that. What do I mean?
A family today, if you are earning $1,000, you should be able to afford a 2-room flat. If you are earning $2,000, you should be able to afford a 3-room flat. If you are earning $4,000, you should be able to afford a 4-room flat and that is completely possible. When I say afford, I mean use your CPF mostly and have a 25-year loan, not a 30-year loan and then in your later years, your income can be used to beef up your retirement savings. So $1K, 2-room flat; $2K, 3-room flat; $4K, 4-room flat; 25-year loan, mostly from your CPF. It can be done, we are almost there. How do we do this? I do not think we want to do this by bringing down the BTO prices because that after a while will bring down all the resale market and everybody who owns a flat in Singapore will be hurt. But we will keep the BTO prices stable for some time; we will increase the support for the lower and middle-income households. And we already have the mechanisms to do this, to subsidise flat purchases. I talked about the Special CPF Housing Grant just now, SHG. We also have the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) which extends to the middle income families as well, lower-middle-income households too. So together, low-income households and middle-income households get a big discount on 2-room flats and 3-room flats, sometimes more than one-third off the price in discounts. But we will do more.
For families who are only able to afford 2-room flats, I would say the 2-room flats are already quite affordable to them. We are happy they are able to buy the 2-room flats; it is a reasonable cost on them every month. But what we should do is to help them when they are ready to upgrade from a 2-room to a 3-room flat when they improve their lives, and we will give them some Step-Up Housing Grants to help them to upgrade later on. So from 2-room if you need to upgrade later, you get help from the Government. For others buying 3-room and 4-room flats, the lower income, the lower-middle income, first-time buyers, 3-room and 4-room flats, we can also do more. The 3-room flats relatively speaking are less of an issue, it is more affordable. The 4-room flats, it is okay but I think we can give more help to the households who are buying them. So we will extend the SHG, which is now only for 2- and 3-room flats, we will extend that also to 4-room. And we will also broaden it so that instead of only for the low income households, we will also allow it for the middle-income households. So what it means, net-net, is a middle-income household buying a 4-room flat can get a saving of up to $20,000, which is not so small. $20,000 more than what they are getting today which is already not so small. So let me explain how this works. I shall be your housing agent.
HDB has a very beautiful development - Fernvale Riverwalk, a BTO project in Sengkang. It is a marvellous place, waterfront living, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room flats, Sengkang West Avenue, Fernvale Link, Punggol Reservoir just down there. There are going to be four residential blocks, 20- to 22 storey-high with spaces for relaxation and bonding. So there will be children’s playgrounds, if you are young kids; there will be adults and elderly fitness stations, you can practise for your IPPT; resting shelters, a precinct pavilion, open green spaces and if you like nature, not very far away, leisure stroll along the boardwalk next to Punggol Reservoir. Hence it is called Fernvale Riverwalk. Furthermore, supermarkets, eating house, shops and a childcare centre. Everything is there. How much do you think a 3-room flat in this place will cost, cheapest? People say flats are expensive. How much do you think they will cost? Think about it. BTO price, I think I should do a poll. I offer you three choices - $150,000, $200,000, $250,000. Who thinks that the cheapest flat is $250,000? Hands up. Who thinks the cheapest flat is $200,000? Hands up. Wow, quite a lot. Who thinks the cheapest flat is $150,000? I think we must vote again. $250,000 is out, so $150,000 and $200,000, your choice. $150,000, hands up. $200,000?. I think $200,000 wins, but actually $200,000 loses, because the cheapest flat is just $150,000. 3-room flats, posted price. So if you add grants, add subsidies, low income families pay even less. But people will say this is only because it is the cheapest flat. So let me take a typical flat in Fernvale Riverwalk, typical 3-room flat and let me show you some sums. I am still your HDB housing agent, remember, but not getting any commission from (Housing Minister) Khaw Boon Wan.
So a typical Fernvale 3-room flat BTO price, let me go through, show you the arithmetic because afterwards we got a stall outside, you can sign (up for a flat). 3-room BTO flat typical price is a bit more than $150,000 but not much more; it is $170,000. Now, let us assume that you are one of the (households with a monthly income of) $2,000 buying this flat. What grants are you going to get? Existing, just the present arrangements, you will have $45,000 of grants already, various things. But now because we have changed our SHG, you will get an extra $10,000 of grant and furthermore if the husband is an NS man, which I think most Singaporeans will be, from the NS Recognition Award, you will have another $4,000 worth of grant down there. So the nett price to him buying the flat, if you have your calculators, is $111,000. So when you think it is $200,000, I think that may be the impression, but it is not accurate. It is actually a lot more affordable than you think. If this household takes a 25-year mortgage, how much will the monthly repayment be? $427. So the CPF can pay all of that, cash repayment every month, zero. So it is not bad. It is so attractive that some people will now ask how about the 4-room flat. So let me show you the 4-room flat sums.
I take a typical flat again is $285,000. It is not the cheapest, the cheapest is about $250,000 odd, but I use a typical example. Household income for this family? Let us say $4,000. Husband and wife working, not hard to achieve. Existing grants for this household, they will already have $15,000 worth of grant but with a new scheme, with SHG extended, they will get $20,000 more. And I assume this is also an NS man, so $4,000 of NS Recognition Award going in towards the flat, so the net price to him is $246,000, less than a quarter million, also affordable. Now supposing they take a mortgage, 25-year mortgage, monthly repayment of $987, of which the CPF will look after $920 and his cash repayment, is all of $67 or about $2 a day. Not bad. And people say HDB is making money. Something is wrong.
This is how we are making HDB flats more affordable and especially more affordable for the less well-off Singaporeans. Let me summarise my points. We have made significant moves in recent years. Tonight, what I have announced is another significant move but it is not the end of the story. We will monitor closely how well people can afford housing in Singapore and over time as it becomes necessary, we will do more to help the lower and the middle income Singaporeans own their homes. We will always make sure that an HDB flat is always within reach, affordable and available to Singaporeans. Do not worry, go ahead, plan on it, get married, get your flat. If you make the effort, the opportunities are there in Singapore.
Besides housing, we will also give Singaporeans more assurance over life’s uncertainties, especially healthcare. Working adults feel the pressure taking care of growing children, also looking after elderly parents. People with chronic illnesses worry, worry about the cost of consultations, the cost of medicines, maybe a few cents a day but day after day, year after year. When you have high blood pressure, the doctor prescribes something to you. He says, please take this, please take this for the rest of your life and you have to take it seriously. Older people worry about the medical bills which they may face and worry about the burden which they may place on their children. So we will improve healthcare financing to give Singaporeans more peace of mind.
First of all, let me talk about outpatient care because that is a significant part of it and then let me say something about inpatient care which is actually a lesser problem but is a big worry to many Singaporeans. But first, outpatient care. One group which is concerned with outpatient care is those with chronic illnesses like Mr Tay Siew Mow, who is 59-years-old, has high blood pressure and regularly visits his GP for check-ups and medication. And as I said, high blood pressure, you have to take the pills for the rest of your life and the consultation and the pills price adds up. So how is he being helped? He is being helped through the CHAS scheme (Community Health Assist Scheme). He has a blue card. Every time he visits his doctor, he gets a subsidy up to $80, it helps pay for the consultation, helps pay for his medications. It is a big saving for him. He has a blue card, his wife has a blue card, his father, his sister, they all have their cards. But he has two teenage children, 15 and 17, and they do not have CHAS cards. Why? Because for CHAS, when we made the scheme, we set a lower limit, you have to be 40 years old before you can join the scheme to get it started. Now that the scheme is well launched, we have 300,000 people on CHAS, the system is working nicely, I think we remove this floor and younger Singaporeans will also be able to join the CHAS scheme, including Mr Tay’s two children. And I think that will diminish his worry about his family’s healthcare costs. So that is one aspect of outpatient treatment.
Another aspect of outpatient treatment is SOCs (Specialist Outpatient Clinics). When you go to the SOCs at SGH (Singapore General Hospital) or Tan Tock Seng, you get a subsidy. But for poor people, it may still add up to an expense. So we will increase the subsidies for the lower- and middle-income patients who are visiting Specialist Outpatient Clinics and we will means-test these additional subsidies so that we know we can target them to the people who need them. I think this is quite a big thing. Many people have expressed their concern to me over the SOC charges. This will make a difference to them.
The third big thing on outpatient treatment, but this is something which will take us some time to do, is Medisave. There are people, many people have asked for Medisave to be used for outpatient treatments. Most recently, Dr Lam Pin Min chaired the committee, the GPC and put up a report. He asked, can we use Medisave for outpatient treatments. I think they are right, we should do this. In principle, this is sound, it is personal responsibility. I save and I use the money when I get sick. If I did not save when I get sick, I must scramble for the cash, it is a problem. We want to move in this direction, we have already taken some steps there. You can use it for chemotherapy, you can use it for major outpatient operations but you go there, you do the operation, you come home. But I think you can extend it further and especially for old people, we can extend it further. We will be studying carefully how to do this. So thank you Pin Min for your suggestion.
So that is outpatient treatment. The other aspect of this inpatient treatment. If we should fall seriously ill, can I afford the hospital bill if I have a very big hospital bill? In reality, there are very few such cases. I wanted to look for a good example for tonight. I scanned all of my MPS cases over the last one year. I had 140 medical cases which in itself is already not a very big number, but none of the 140 medical cases had huge hospital bills. So I asked MOH, please find me a good example. MOH scanned their database. They also found very, very few examples. So in fact, if you are on MediShield, which most people are, you do not need to worry. Can I have a show of hands who is not on MediShield down here? Nobody, so you are alright. You should be alright but I know that even though I can explain this to you and you can understand what I am saying, people still worry. And some people do not have MediShield cover and they could have a problem because MediShield, it reaches 92 per cent of people but some of the older folks may not have it, some of the people who have pre-existing conditions may have fallen out, may not have it. And also there is another third group, the very old people, because MediShield stops at the age of 90. And there are quite a number of Singaporeans who are now more than 90 years old, including Mr Yasmuddin Rasul whom I showed you a picture of just now, he is 92, and of course Mr Ho Tee Soon who is 104. So, what will we do?
I think we revamp, relaunch MediShield, we give it a new name. We call it MediShield Life. Why MediShield Life? Because it will cover you for life. If you do not stop at 90, the Medishield Life will not stop at 90. So do not worry, it will cover old people. Secondly, MediShield Life will be universal. It will cover everybody, every Singaporean, old ones, young ones, those newly-born. Even those who are now outside the MediShield network, we will bring them back in. You may be elderly, you may have dropped out, you may have pre-existing illnesses, we will bring you back in. It may cost you a bit more but it can be done. There will be no more opting out from MediShield. Thirdly, MediShield Life will give you better protection for very large hospital bills. The patients will pay less out-of-pocket or out of their Medisave. I think the burden on the children, on the families will be less. So, three key things on MediShield Life. One, it is for life; two, it is universal for everybody; three, it gives you better cover for very big hospital bills. But because it does more, because the benefits are better, therefore, the MediShield Life’s premiums will have to be higher. It has to be, because it has to break even and I think for most people that will not be a problem. But for a few that could be a problem and for those who cannot afford, the Government will subsidise this MediShield Life premiums for them.
This is a very, very major step. We thought about it long and hard. We have argued it and we have decided we need to do it. But how exactly to design the scheme, I think we need to take some more time. And we need to consult and get views. So, we are going to do a public consultation, seek views before we decide on the details of the scheme and it will take a year, maybe more than that. But I think it is important that we try and get this started right because it is a very important step towards providing people protection and assurance that for medical care, you can be taken care of.
One group which we need to take special care of is our pioneer generation. They are special. They are the ones who worked hard to build today’s Singapore. The generation to independence: 60s, 70s, 80s. They made this place. They enabled us today to enjoy these facilities. They earned less than us. They had fewer safety nets when they were working. They brought up this generation and they paved the way for us to live a better life than themselves. That was their goal. They achieved it and I think we should know that and we should be grateful to them. Now mostly they are retired, at least in their late 60s, many older. And we must take special care of this pioneer generation in their golden years. We have recognised them and given them something extra. Every time we have had a bonus exercise, a scheme, Minister for Finance, each time we designed a scheme, we distribute something for the senior citizens, the pioneer generation, something extra. Whether it is home care subsidies, whether it is GST vouchers, whether it is a Resilience Package, we make sure that they are treated different. And I think in these new healthcare arrangements, we will likewise make sure that they are well taken care of. So, we will have a special Pioneer Generation Package to help pay for their premiums for this group under MediShield Life, to make sure that our pioneer generation will be well-covered and would not need to worry about healthcare in their old age. I think we owe it to them.
What I have talked about on healthcare so far is what the Government is doing, but there is always that aspect which the individual must do. We each have to take personal responsibility for ourselves, both financing and also just looking after our health. We are going to spend more on healthcare year by year. The Government subsidies are going up and will go up some more. But some part of it has to be paid by ourselves and each of us must save enough to pay for our share. Therefore, I think you can guess what my next line will be - Medisave rates have to go up. It has to be. We will increase these contribution rates over time as and when our economic conditions permit. How, how much, we will have to discuss carefully. But the direction is quite clear, we need to save more and that will stand us in good stead because one day we will all grow old, if we are lucky. But the best way for us generally to keep healthcare costs down is to stay healthy and especially for older people because for older people exercise is not just keeping fit or keeping well but also making friends, having the social contacts, the networks, the mutual support.
Somebody who can keep an eye on you to say, are you all right? Something is not quite right with you, your walk has changed. You are not quite so steady, you are stuttering. Please see the doctor. And that is an important part of keeping old folks well. And I think the Wellness Programme, the Active Ageing Programme which Boon Heng has been pushing and is still pushing has been making a big difference in this. I met one group recently when I went to Jalan Besar. I went to Geylang West CC and there was a Cheerobics group there. This group of old people. What is Cheerobics? Cheerleading plus aerobics. Cheerleading is something which usually teenage young people do at football games, prancing around and throwing people up in the air. But old folks can do Cheerobics too. Let us see. (Cheerobics video plays.) Older than most of us but I think dancing and prancing around faster and better than most of us do.
The third major shift which we will make is to do more to keep paths upwards wide open to all. Keeping paths wide open has been a fundamental principle for Singapore for a very long time. It is how we have enhanced our human potential. How we have created hope for every Singaporean and is especially true in education and that is why we have invested in pre-school, adding 20,000 places in the next five years as I said just now in Chinese. That is why we are going to contribute to Edusave accounts of every child between the age of 7 and 16, whether they are madrasah students, home-schoolers, overseas students, which I said in the Malay speech. These are signals that we value every child and that we want to give every person the best possible chance to start off well in life. Education is a big concern for parents and students because it plays a big role in shaping one’s potential and opportunities in Singapore. Parents know that, they want the best for their children. And therefore when it comes to key education milestones, these are high stress moments for the whole family, whether it is P1 admission, whether it is PSLE, the whole family gets involved.
There are two different perspectives on education, on schools in Singapore. One is the MOE perspective - Every School Is A Good School. Whichever school you go to, whichever class or principal you have, you will get a good education. And we give every school the teachers, the resources, the backing. We help many of our schools develop niches of excellence. We make sure that the whole system is of a high standard. Every school is a good school. But parents and students have a different perspective. They accept the MOE argument but they still have strong preferences for certain schools. And even within the same housing estate, two separate schools, few hundred metres apart, parents will go to great lengths to bring their children into School A instead of School B. I see it every year when it comes to school admission time after the PSLE exams, when people come and try very, very hard. Having got a place in a good school, they want a place in another school which in their view will be better for their kid. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they do not. But the belief is very deep. And nationally that happens too, because secondary schools admit students from across the country and based on their academic results. So, the results of parents looking for what they think are the best schools and consulting websites like kiasuparents.com -- I am past that point, but I have not reached kiasugrandparents.com yet -- but the result of that is certain top secondary schools get a very high concentration of the very good students or at least the students with very good results. So in these top secondary schools, standards are very high, competition to get in is very intense and everybody feels enormous pressure. So you have these two views, one, MOE - Every School is A Good School. Two, parents, I prefer School A to School B. You ask me what is my take; let me tell you my take.
I believe we can make every school a good school and we have done a lot of that to ensure that every school provides a good education for the students. We give them the resources, we give them the good teachers, we emphasise values and we have made a lot of progress towards this goal. I asked MOE for some examples. They gave me two examples, both from Bukit Batok. I think the MP will be pleased. The first one is Bukit View Primary School where children perform drama to develop their confidence and they put on performances. The second one is Hillgrove Secondary School where they do Flight and Aerospace Education and this thing which you see buzzing around (pointing to slide), this is one of the super light kites with propellers which sometimes come put on a show at National Day. So, every school is a good school and I push MOE very hard to give the schools the resources, the good principals, the flexibility, the authority to teach students according to their students’ needs, to make the system work. And it is a philosophy which is not just for schools but even post-secondary levels. You look at this ITE campus – $500 million of investments, $500 million. Passionate lecturers, high quality programmes. Therefore, students are proud of themselves, wanting to be here, confident that beyond this, there are many possibilities in life.
So, we want every school to be good. But I am a realist. I accept that parents and students will always carefully choose which schools to go to. And I think it is good that parents compare and choose schools because it puts pressure on the schools to know that the parents are watching and that it makes a difference how they perform. But it is important that parents compare and contrast and choose on the right basis, not just examination grades but also how well the schools are really educating their children. Because you may have good grades because your children happen to be bright. But you may not be doing anything for them. They may be just educating themselves. You may have children who are not so naturally talented but with good education, you improve their performance, you make a big difference to them. So the quality of the schools, academically, in terms of character education, in terms of civic education, in terms of developing their students’ interest - if the parents are comparing schools like that and choosing schools like that, then I think we have the right incentives and it will work.
What about top schools? I think it is also good that we have top schools nationally, schools which are acknowledged as outstanding, so long as we keep our system open. The system has to be open, meaning there cannot be barriers to entry. Outstanding students must always be able to make it to the top to get into these institutions and you cannot have a closed, self-perpetuating elite - I am here, my children are here, you are not in this magic circle, you cannot come in. Some societies become like that. We must never become like that. We must have many pathways in our system, an open system so students can come in. If they do not fit, they go out. If later on, they develop, they could come in. There are many other points when they can come in depending on their performance and depending on their ability. If you have this, we have a high base, we have peaks and you have a landscape with many peaks of excellence and there is pressure on raising standards across the board. We give good education to all our children. We can uplift the whole education system. If we have a completely flat and featureless system – every school is exactly the same as every other school, no difference – you will have not excellence, but mediocrity. In the old days in China they used to have that. You would be so and so city, School No. 37, and the next one is School No. 38, and what is the difference? Just the number, everything else is the same. Nobody makes the effort. Today in China they have a very complicated landscape. They have experimental schools, they have elite institutions. It is a socialist society, but the schools compete. Our schools we make sure all of them are good but all of them have to keep on competing to be good.
We have an excellent education system. But our society is getting more stratified. Competition is intensifying amongst our students and the focus, unfortunately I think, is too much on examination performance and not enough on learning. It is very hard to fight these forces because parents want the best for their children and they think the examination results are what makes the difference. But I think we need to recalibrate to keep our system open and to focus on things which matter more than exam grades in the long run. But the education system is a very complicated and delicate machinery. You can say what you like or do not like about it; you cannot just push it and expect it to become better. You must find the right spot, fine tune, make the precise adjustment and then watch carefully to see whether it has become better. So, I am proposing to make four small adjustments which I will tell you about tonight - starting at P1 admissions.
P1 admissions is a complicated process. You have got Phase One, Phase Two, 2A, 2B, 2C and so forth. And it gives priority to siblings, to children of alumni, to the school community - for a reason. Because we want each school to develop its traditions, its history, and its identity. We want the school to have a community which cares for it. We want the school to be proud of itself, to have to know where it has come from and to feel that. When I wear the uniform, there is a history behind this. I come from Nanyang - Nanyang and Hwa Chong go back a long way. I come from Catholic High - that means something. And likewise with so many other schools and I think we want to preserve this. But at the same time we do not want our primary schools to be closed institutions and you can only get in if your parents have been there. In the past, even popular primary schools usually would have places available for children who did not have any connection with the school. But over time, the number of places for these unconnected children have shrunk and you can see in this year’s P1 registration exercise, quite a number of schools have had to ballot earlier in the process which means for the later phases there are already no more places left. And if we do nothing, one day these schools may have no places left at all for those who have no connections, which I think will be bad. So we have got to strike a balance. The alumni would prefer us to keep the system. The public? They have different views. OSC discussed this; the participants proposed solutions. One says, give absolute priority to those who are living nearby, which is fine if you happen to be living nearby the school you want to go to, or if you can afford to buy a house nearby the school you want to go to, but it is not such an ideal system if you take it from a system point of view. Somebody else said do away with all these priorities, flatten it out, 100 per cent balloting. Just have racial quotas to make sure every school is mixed. 100 per cent balloting. We will be back to the school number 37, 38 or 99 and I suppose you will wear school uniforms where you put the number on them.
I do not think these extreme solutions will work and anyway, whatever solution you make, parents will find ingenious ways to maximise their chances. For example, one mother moved house four times to give her older children a better chance to get into the primary schools. In Chinese they say meng mu san qian (孟母三迁). This one outdoes that. Meng mu san qian refers to Meng Zhi’s mother who moved home three times because her neighbours were unsuitable, so they finally moved to a place where her neighbours were suitable and Meng Zhi could grow up properly. Here, the neighbours were perfectly suitable, the mother was looking for a place to get into the right school. Four times! Outdoes Meng Zhi’s mother. Some couples split up, two of them holding handphones with instant communication. You go to school A and I go to school B. They update each other in real time - is it balloting, how many, what are the chances, where shall I put my name in? It becomes a military operation.
So I think we need to strike a better balance. From next year, every primary school will set aside 40 places, at least, for children who have no prior connection with the school in Primary One. And we will give every Singaporean child a chance to enter the primary school of his choice. It does not mean we will be able to accommodate everybody, there may be a scramble and you will have to ballot for these 40 places, but at least the school will be open and it will never become completely closed. But at the same time, we are continuing to upgrade the quality of every primary school and MOE has asked me to say this again and I say it with conviction. We are doing this. You can take it on faith from me that I am going to invest in all of the schools and whichever school your child gets into, we are going to try to do our very best for him or her.
The second small thing we are going to do is something about the PSLE, the scoring system. The PSLE is one of our most important examinations or at least, many parents think that the PSLE is one of our most important examinations. Because it is not just a report of the student’s performance in primary school, but parents think that this determines the student’s future. I just had an email from somebody who wrote to me to say, please be very careful when you touch the PSLE, because the problem is not the exam. The problem is that parents think that the exams count for everything in the world. If you go to this stream, you are fixed for life; you go to that stream, you are fixed for life; if you go there, well, you are set for life. So that is the problem. So I replied to him, I said no, I do not agree that that (i.e. the stream determining one’s path for life) is the how our education system works but I shall be very careful. He replied to me again, he says, I do not agree that is how the education works either but that is how parents think and therefore, we have to be cognisant of that and we have to take that into account and I think we must do that. But whatever it is, because of all this, because of the way the parents think, there is a tremendous stress when it comes to the PSLE exam. The whole family takes the examination! I knew that people went on leave for PSLE but I watched a snippet on Mediacorp recently, and this mother said she actually stopped work for the whole year to take the PSLE with her daughter! What do we do? I asked, what did the OSC people say? One group went into this, came back and reported, we discussed this at length, we do not like the existing system at all, we looked at all sorts of alternatives, we could not agree on an alternative which was a better way to post the students to secondary schools. So the recommendation finally - please do not change the PSLE system. But I think we should make some careful changes to the PSLE system.
Just to put this in perspective - the PSLE, everybody thinks it matters, heaven and earth. But I do not know what my PSLE grade is. I think many of you who are my age do not know what your PSLE grade is either because when I took the PSLE nearly 50 years ago, in fact, 50 years ago in 1963 already, the scores were confidential. MOE never told anybody the scores. The students were only told whether they had passed or they had failed and which school they had been posted to. So we were all gathered in the car park in Nanyang waiting anxiously while the teachers went through the list and tallied up who passed, who failed and then came out after a very long wait and told us who passed, who failed. Luckily, I passed!
But today, it is different. Today, everybody knows his T-score. Not just everybody knows his T-score, everybody knows his friends’ T-score and his friends’ sons or daughters’ T-score. When they meet they compare notes, saying “how much did your daughter get? Wah, 230, not bad, can get into this school or not? And what about him, did you hear that one went to 180? Wah, do not know what happened”. It happens, so I do not think it is a good thing. One-point difference in the PSLE scores, 230 versus 231, may make all the difference in your secondary school posting. But at the age of 12, one examination, four papers and you want to measure the child to so many decimal points and say well, this one got one point better than that child? It is a distinction which is meaningless and too fine to make. Who is going to grow up abler, more committed, more capable, a better contributor to society? At the age of 12, you can guess, you cannot tell. Certainly, you cannot tell based on one point difference and I do not think we should decide secondary school postings based on such fine distinctions.
So we will score PSLE differently. We will use wider bands for grades, ‘O’ levels are like that, ‘A’ levels are like that. ‘O’ levels, you have A1 all the way down to 9 which is a fail. ‘A’ levels, I am not sure how exactly, but you also have A, B, C, D, E but I think if we have a system of grades like that rather than precise scores, it will reduce the excessive competition to chase that last point. If you get an A* that is an A*, it does not matter where it is 91 A* or 99 A*. It is an A* and that is good enough. You do not have to chase that last point. Then you will be able to sit back and you have space to educate and develop the students more holistically. But what I am talking about is what we are intending to do. It will take us some time, several years. So if you are taking the PSLE in a few months’ time or if your son or your grandson is taking PSLE in a few months’ time, please do not panic. We are not going to do anything this year. It is going to take several years to do.
We have to have a system which can fit each of these cases and we will adapt it to that person.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
Next, let me say something about having more flexibility in secondary schools. We want secondary schools to have the flexibility to tailor the education of their students to their abilities and the development of their students. Some develop faster than others, some have interest in certain subjects more than others, some are good at all subjects, a few are weak at many subjects. We have to have a system which can fit each of these cases and we will adapt it to that person. Already we have some flexibility between points, between PSLE to ‘N’ levels, or ‘O’ levels to ‘A’ levels. You can cross over; you are not fixed in one stream or one course. And we have students who have made this and transferred. For example, I have two young people here who have made this. I have Lim Chi Siang, who is here with us this evening. He went from EM3; he went to Normal (Academic) stream in Si Ling Secondary School. He went on to Yishun JC and after JC, he has made it to NUS to study Physics. He is now doing NS but after NS, NUS is there, the place is available to him. So the system has given him the chance, the time to develop, make sure he learns properly, next stage take a bit longer, five years rather than four in ‘N’ levels, then JC he made good, now he is going to university. Or another example, Ahmad Muhammad bin Rosman, who had a difficult family background. He went from EM3 to Normal (Tech). Many people do not prefer Normal (Tech). From Normal (Tech) he went to ITE. ITE did a good job with him. He did well, he skipped the Higher NITEC course, he has entered Singapore Poly and he is doing a Diploma in Visual Effects and Motion Graphics. So one day, he will help me make graphics for my presentation.
So we want more people to be like them and we will create more flexible choices in secondary schools. And we will do this progressively. What we will do is allow Secondary One students, whichever stream you are in, you can take a subject at a higher level if you have done well in that subject in PSLE. So you may be in Normal (Academic) but if you have done well in Maths, you can do that subject at ‘O’ levels when you go to secondary school. You may be in Normal (Tech), you are good in languages, you can take languages at ‘N’ level or at ‘O’ level when you are in secondary school. You will have that flexibility so that you can learn each subject at a pace appropriate to you, you can build on your strengths and build up your confidence, your pride and then you can go further and fulfil your potential. I think this is a step, one step in the direction to making our system more open, more flexible. Go ahead (and clap). Not to cheer me, cheer the students who will now have the chances to move ahead. They deserve it.
Finally, let me say something about the top schools. This is a somewhat awkward subject. We want every school to be a good school. Why are there top schools in Singapore? I think there are top schools in Singapore; it is good that we have these outstanding schools in our system with very high standards. It is a tribute to the teachers, the students and also to our education system. Many of these schools have long history and traditions, some even longer than Singapore’s. Over time, they have produced many leaders – leaders in the private sector, leaders in the social services and leaders in the government. They have produced not just successful people but pillars of our society. Not the only way to do so but a significant number of people have done so. Therefore, it is all the more critical that these schools should develop their students holistically and admit their students holistically and imbue the right ethos and values to them, expose them to diverse backgrounds, to build empathy and understanding and make sure the students stay rooted in the society which has nurtured them and invested hopes in them. Most importantly, we need to keep the admissions to the top schools open, so they do not also become closed circles. Not closed because you have to have certain parents, but closed because you have to have perfect grades. So I think that you should take not just students with outstanding academic results, but also very good students with other special qualities - qualities of character, of resilience, of drive, leadership - people who can show that they can make a difference in the world. And the top schools also must make sure that students from low-income backgrounds are not put off from applying to enter for fear that they cannot afford it, or that they cannot fit in because sometimes you can afford it, but if you do not feel comfortable because you feel like your friends are talking about things which you cannot afford, you feel out of place and I think that is bad and should not happen. So we must do something more to keep this spirit of openness and to enhance this diversity of opportunity for admission into the top schools.
What will we do? Two major things. One, the top schools, in fact all schools, have a DSA programme, a Direct School Admissions programme. We will broaden the DSA categories. Now if you are outstanding in arts, in sports, even in academics, you can come in on the DSA. But we must broaden this to also take into account character, resilience, drive, leadership. We have got to get the top schools to actively seek out such students, look for them. Some of them have scholarships for these schemes. We have got to get and invite primary schools to suggest possible students to the schools or suggest to the students that they take an interest (in their secondary school postings), explore it. You do not have to go there, it is not the only way up, but if you are thinking of going there, you do not have to worry. The opportunity is there, the door is open. So one, I think we should make a big effort in this to try and bring in people with the attributes we are looking for. But secondly, I think we can do more to enhance financial assistance and bursary schemes for these schools. We have the schemes; we should enhance them substantially so that anybody who qualifies and wants to attend these top secondary schools can confidently do so. And that way we can make sure that our top schools stay open, produce graduates who become assets to our society and are connected to Singapore and to our whole community which they belong to. I think that is the right way forward for us to go.
So these changes to our education system will help to keep our pathways upwards open to all and make meritocracy work better for Singapore. Meritocracy has to remain the most fundamental organising principle in our society. We have to recognise people for their contributions and their effort, not for their backgrounds, not for their status or wealth or connections. This cannot be a society which is based on guan xi (connections). It must be based on your ability, your contributions, what are you giving back to the society. So at the same time, if you succeed under our system, then you must feel the duty to contribute back because you did not do it alone. Therefore, if that works, we invest in you, you give back, then everyone will benefit from the system and will see it as fair and good. ESM Goh recently went down to RI for an alumni dinner and he described this as building a “compassionate meritocracy” and I think he was exactly on the point. One good example of this in action is Dr Yeo Sze Ling. She is here with us this evening. I met her and I thought I should tell you about her. Dr Yeo Sze Ling became blind at the age of four. She studied at the Singapore School for the Visually Handicapped. She did not go to a brand name school. She went to Bedok South Secondary School, Serangoon JC. She had an interest in Mathematics, she was good at it, she read Mathematics in NUS and she graduated with three degrees, including a PhD in Math. I stare at a page of Math with the formulas; I do not understand what is going on sometimes. But to be able to imagine it, visualise it, manipulate it, express it, that is amazing. She topped the Faculty of Science in her year, now she is a research scientist at A*STAR and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at NTU. (Pointing to slide) And here you see her, she is operating a Braille typewriter with headphones and so the headphones read back presumably the mathematical formula which she is typing in. But she is not just a successful professional, she is volunteering at the Society for the Physically Disabled, helping others to overcome their disabilities, which is why she richly deserved to win the Singapore Youth Award last year where I met her. Well done, Sze Ling! Sze Ling proves that you can do well if you work hard. It does not matter what your circumstances are and that is what we have to try to do to contribute back to the society and keep the system fair for all.
I have described how the Government will do more in this new balance but for this new balance to work, we all have a part to play. The Government can provide a flat but it is up to us to make a home. The Government can make healthcare more affordable but it is up to us to take care of ourselves and one another. The Government can make our education system more open but it is up to us to seize the opportunities and realise our potential. The community will also have to do more to complement the individual efforts and the Government’s programmes. And the community is alive and well in Singapore. We saw it during the recent haze. We had young people like Sylvester Yeo who donated his own money to provide N95 masks for elderly cleaners and hawkers. We had taxi drivers who bought and distributed masks to one another so that taxis could continue to operate. We had grassroots efforts to deal with day-to-day issues. I came across one example recently in Siglap, Loyang Villas which is a private estate where Dr Maliki, who is the MP, worked with them to solve a problem. They had a problem of indiscriminate parking, which I think many private estates have. So they had a dialogue, Dr Maliki encouraged them to come together and work out a solution among themselves. So the residents set up a taskforce to study the problem and discuss what could be done. The taskforce produced a “Code of Conduct for Responsible Parking”. (Reading Code of Conduct) Code of conduct, item number two - we should park at least one vehicle within our porch or driveway. Makes sense, right? Item number three - we should not place objects to “chope” (reserve) parking spaces, so hence you see the dustbins down there, I presume now removed. They saved on parking aunties and maybe the other estates can learn something from them.
But I am particularly cheered that many young people are doing good work. For example, I showed you some pictures earlier of my residents - Mr and Mrs Lim, Mr Ho Tee Soon who is 104, Mdm Puranam who is selling spices at my market. How did I get those pictures? They were a PAYM project in my CC. The PAYM mobilised themselves, they went around, interviewed residents, learnt their stories, took pictures of them, put up an exhibition in Teck Ghee CC. (Ms Khoo) Hanzhi was the photographer. I saw the exhibition and decided this is what I am going to use for my National Day Rally. Thank you very much, Hanzhi!
Other students are more ambitious. They go overseas to do good work. Singapore Poly did a Project NEPAL (Never Ending Passion and Love). They went to Nepal and they did a project building classrooms for the children there. You can see it is hot and dusty but it is a good experience for them. So we want to encourage more young people to build a better world and a better Singapore. You are our future. You are idealistic, full of energy and passion. Go forth, change Singapore, change the world, for the better.To help you do that, we will set up a youth volunteer corps. We will expand opportunities for young people to do projects in our community, especially students in our post-secondary institutions - the ITEs, the polys and universities. The youth corps will provide resources to support you, funding to start your own projects, allowances to take say a term off for full-time community service. Grants, so after graduation you can continue serving the community. It will offer mentors to guide you, advise you, make the most of your efforts, match you with critical community needs, help you to make a difference to our nation.
We want to ensure that every Singaporean shares in the nation’s progress.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
These new policies – housing, healthcare and education – are very significant shifts. They are part of “Our New Way Forward”. But our ultimate destination and core purpose have not changed. We want to ensure that every Singaporean shares in the nation’s progress. We want to support the less fortunate and the vulnerable. We want to create opportunities for Singaporeans to do your best and ultimately, to build a stronger Singapore. It is going to take some time to work out the policies and programmes and to realise this new balance between the state, the community and the individual. It is going to take still more time to show results and we will assess how our strategies, our policies and programmes turn out and then as we gain experience and as our needs evolve, we will take further steps carefully forward. We are not taking these steps because our system is bad. On the contrary, we are starting from a strong position. Whether it is housing, whether it is healthcare, whether it is education, whatever our qualms, whatever our grumbles, whatever we may gripe about sometime, it is not perfect but by international standards they are all excellent and that is a fact.Even transport, which worries many Singaporeans, we are making progress with new buses, with new train lines, with new free early morning MRT rides into the city. Even our baseline by international comparisons, honestly speaking, is not bad. And I am glad that some people appreciate our transport system like this couple, Mr and Mrs Wesley Lim. They did not just pose in front of the railway carriage. Instead of a wedding limo, the MRT got them to the church on time. And as Wesley said, “The ride of our lives. Who needs an S-Class when you can have an $8 billion Circle Line?” So I encourage more of you to do that.
Our new strategic direction will take us down a different road from the one that has brought us here so far. There is no turning back. I believe this is the right thing to do given the changes in Singapore, given the major shifts in the world. We proceed but let me sound a word of caution: All this is not without risk.
Other countries have tried to do similar things in the past with the best intentions but ended up with unwanted outcomes. America has the highest healthcare spending in the world.
Their outcomes are worse than many developed countries, including Singapore. Finland has comprehensive protections for workers, yet 20 per cent of its youth is unemployed despite a good economy and a good education system. It could happen to us. Therefore, we have to tread carefully, beware the pitfalls. We will do more for the low income but we cannot undermine self-reliance. We will increase healthcare spending but we cannot encourage over consumption and unnecessary treatments. We will make the education system broader and more open but we cannot compromise academic standards and rigour.
And finally of course, all good things have to be paid for. For now we can afford these measures from existing revenues. In the longer term, their costs will rise, especially healthcare costs. MediShield Life and additional subsidies. Over time the amount will grow year-by-year. Today, people accuse us “why are we spending so little on healthcare?” One day we will be lamenting “why are we spending so much, how do we save?”. The risks are there. We have to realise this, we have to be prepared to pay for this, whether by raising taxes, whether by cutting back on other spending, if we want to keep the social safety nets and the programmes. We cannot saddle our children’s generation with debt so as to pay for our consumption. And I think Singaporeans know this. When I posted onto my Facebook page what I was going to talk about at the National Day Rally, one reader – Julie Chin - commented on my Wall and she spoke absolute sense. She said: “I just hope any changes are not populist ones that aim to appease the angry, entitled populace and put the burden on our kids and grandkids in the future. I would rather I have it tougher now just so my kids will not have a heavier burden to carry later.” And I think she spoke absolute sense. We are here now because our parents had it tougher and built this for us. For us to say let us be comfortable and let our kids take care of themselves, I think that is irresponsible.
We must pass on to our children a better Singapore than the one we inherited. We owe it to them to do so. Just as we owe what we have today to our founding generation. Dr Goh Keng Swee, another of our founding fathers once said, “We must not think of where we are as the pinnacle of achievement, but as a base from which to scale new heights.” And I am glad that our young people are up to this challenge. On National Day last week, I opened the newspaper or rather I looked at it on my iPad, and I was greatly cheered to read a Forum letter from a young lady, 15-year-old student, Ms Cheang Ko Lyn. And she said “Singapore is not perfect and there may be flaws. But if we do not fight to protect and build it, no one else will. It is precisely because Singapore is not perfect that my generation must remain here, working to further improve it. We are all still learning, so have a little faith in our country.” And she quoted Mr Lee Kuan Yew what he said back in 1967: “There is tranquillity, poise and confidence in Singapore. And it is a confidence born out of the knowledge that there were very few problems which we cannot overcome.” And then she ended by saying, “Let us not be the generation which forgets that.” I think it made my day and if our young people feel this way then I think it is our responsibility and my responsibility to make sure that in fact they are able to fulfil their dreams. As the OSC participants said, to build a Singapore with Opportunities, with Purpose, with Assurance, with Community Spirit and Trust. A home where we celebrate many talents like Anthony Chen, whose “Ilo Ilo” film won the Cannes Camera d’Or for Best First Film. Or the LionsXII, who won the Malaysian Super League after 19 long years. Above all, a society where the human spirit flourishes.
To realise these dreams, we need to do the tangible things too - to build our city, to improve our living environment, to prosper our economy. And we are doing so all over Singapore. Punggol Waterway, a beautiful river for residents in Punggol and all over Singapore - not far from Fernvale Riverwalk. Jurong Lake District, an integrated town with homes, offices and leisure by the lake. The Sports Hub opening next April, a beautiful new stadium to watch sports. Also many facilities to play sports, whether as a professional athlete or weekend warrior. And maybe one day I can hold my NDR there too!
These are things already happening but beyond that, we have to plan and dream and build for the very long term. Take for example, Changi Airport. What is Changi Airport? To travellers - an icon of Singapore. To Singaporeans - a welcome landmark telling us that we have arrived home. To me it is a part of the Singapore identity - a symbol of renewal and change. I was one of the first passengers to use Changi Airport in 1981. In fact I took off on a test flight before the airport opened – I was a guinea pig to help test the airport systems. MINDEF chartered a flight to some secret place for training and we took off in the middle of the night, went through immigration, customs, searched and they picked up my knife in my hand luggage. Fortunately it was an experiment and, I kept my knife. But they (the customs officers) were on duty, it worked. We arrived home a few weeks later at Changi Airport. Paya Lebar had moved to Changi. Changi was in full business. We found Changi a vast improvement compared to the old Paya Lebar Airport. The control tower was especially beautiful.
But Changi Airport is more than an emotional symbol. It is how the world comes to Singapore and how Singaporeans connect with the world. It is why we thrive as an international hub for business, for trade, for tourism. The airport and all the things which are connected with the airport, all the related services, they provide a lot of jobs in Singapore. I would not ask you to guess how many. But it is 163,000 jobs in Singapore, 6 per cent of the GDP and it is all levels of society. When air travel goes down during SARS, during a recession, taxi drivers feel it immediately. Especially the taxi drivers living in Tampines and Pasir Ris nearby, business is down, the queue at the airport of taxis becomes longer. But the airport is also the reason for our vibrant aerospace industry and the popularity of our aerospace courses in schools. For example, here in ITE College Central, we have an Aerospace Engineering course. In fact there is a Boeing 737 outside. A real aeroplane here to train our students, avionics, airframe, mechanics, engines. I posted this picture (referring to slide) on Facebook. Somebody asked, is that (Boeing 737) real or is that photoshopped? I said it is real. It is here because we are the hub, because we have Changi Airport. And we have Changi Airport today because in the 1970s, forty years ago, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had the vision to imagine the old RAF Changi Airbase becoming an international airport to replace Paya Lebar and he pushed for it against the advice of experts who recommended expanding Paya Lebar, building a second runway in Paya Lebar. Can you imagine? One runway in Paya Lebar, already aeroplanes coming in and going out over so many houses. (What more) two runways in Paya Lebar? But Mr Lee said no, study, study, study again. Got Howe Yoon Choon to lead it who pushed it and made it happened. And I think we owe it to them and we are grateful to them.
So we inherited this but we have also progressively expanded and upgraded Changi over the years. Now three terminals, handling 51 million passengers last year. Can still grow some, but approaching its limits and the business is growing. Passenger traffic is up. All over Asia, middle-classes are travelling, air travel is booming. People are going on holiday, doing business. Singaporeans are travelling all over the world. National Day weekend, how many of you were not in Singapore? I was recently on holiday in Japan, went to Mt Fuji. I met more Singaporeans on Mt Fuji than Japanese. Other airports in Southeast Asia are expanding to take advantage of these opportunities. KLIA, they are planning to service 100 million passengers per year. Bangkok Suvarnabhumi (Airport) also aiming for 100 million passengers a year and both of them are geographically better-placed than Singapore to be the hub in Southeast Asia. Because from Europe to Southeast Asia to the Far East whether it is Hongkong or Japan or China, KL is nearer, Bangkok is nearer still. But we are the hub. Why? Because they are not Changi Airport! That makes a difference.
Now the question is: Do we want to stay this vibrant hub of Southeast Asia or do we want to let somebody take over our position, our business and our jobs? That is our choice. Do we want to let somebody else eat our cheese? And I think we must be part of this growth and we have to plan ahead and continually build up Changi. And we have plans to do so. (Talks through video) Today, in Changi we already have T1, T2 and T3. They are there but we will keep on upgrading them. We are building a new terminal. There was a budget terminal. They said they are rebuilding a budget terminal, next thing I knew it became a T4. I told them it does not look like a budget (terminal) anymore. But the business is there. It will be good and we have one more trick outside T1, we will build something special. There is a carpark there, open air car park there, since the beginning. It should not still be there. We are going to replace with what we have codenamed “Project Jewel”. “Project Jewel” looks like this. We will expand T1, so T1 will be connected with it as will the others. But it will have shops, restaurants and a beautiful indoor garden. So we have Gardens by the Bay, this one is Gardens at the Airport. Not just for visitors but for Singaporeans too – families on Sunday outings, students maybe studying for exams, newly-weds taking bridal photos.
For the longer term, we are already planning T5. T5 sounds like a terminal but actually it is a whole airport by itself, as big as today’s Changi Airport but connected together so it all operates as one. Two runways, third runway, new T5, doubling the capacity. Starting work now, target date, mid-2020s –12, 15 years time. And this is how we can stay the hub in Southeast Asia and create many more opportunities for Singaporeans. But this is just one phase. Beyond this we have further bold plans because we are going to build a new RSAF airbase and a new runway at Changi - Changi East Airbase. And why are we doing that because if we do that, we can move Paya Lebar Airbase to Changi East and free up Paya Lebar Airbase. You look at this area, it is 800 hectares. It is bigger than Ang Mo Kio, it is bigger than Bishan. But it moves out, we will build new homes, new offices, new factories, new parks, new living environments, new communities. But in fact, it is not just these 800 ha. Because if you move the airbase, you remove the height restrictions on a big area around the airbase which are now constrained because you have to take off, you have to land, you have to provide safety and that frees us to develop new exciting plans for the big chunk of eastern Singapore, going all the way down to Marina and Marina South. So you are talking about 2030 and beyond, and it would not fully happen for maybe 20, 30 years after that because houses are built, houses do not need to be pulled down overnight. But the potential is there. We can dream.
Besides Paya Lebar, we also have plans for our port in Tanjong Pagar. Tanjong Pagar, with Brani, with Keppel, with Pasir Panjang, is one of the busiest ports in the world. Business is good. The port has been very successful. It is growing, it is reaching its limits. So we are building a new port in Tuas, bigger, more efficient, almost double the present capacity. And then we can stay the hub port and make sure the business stays here. And when this is done, we can move from Tanjong Pagar to Tuas. Starting 2027 when the ports’ leases expire and when they move to Tuas, you will free up the prime land in Tanjong Pagar. And there we can build a Southern Waterfront City. This is a satellite picture, so you can see it all on one screen. But it is a huge area. It 1,000 ha, or 2.5 times the size of Marina Bay, all the way from Shenton Way to Pasir Panjang, from the east all the way to the west.
We are not done building Singapore, we never will.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
These are very ambitious, long-term plans. It is an example of how we need to think and plan for our future. And it reflects our fundamental mindset and spirit – to be confident, to look ahead, to aim high. If we can carry off these plans, we do not have to worry about running out of space or possibilities for Singapore. We are not at the limit, the sky is the limit! We are creating possibilities for the future. We are opening up opportunities for our children, for their children to continue to build, to upgrade, to reinvent the city for many more years to come.
Very few countries or cities anywhere in the world can think or plan over such a long term. But Singapore has been able to do it. This is how we got here and this is what we must do to be here tomorrow, next year and for many years to come. But in a deeper sense, these are not plans. These are acts of faith in Singapore and in ourselves. Faith that a generation from now Singapore will still be here, and will still be worth investing in, for the sake of our grandchildren and their grandchildren. Faith that we can thrive in the world, whatever the challenges, and hold our own against the competition, bigger, stronger, but we are there. Faith that we can get our politics right, that we can throw up honest, capable, trusted people to lead our country well, to make our system work for Singaporeans. Faith that we can stay together as one united people, maintain a steady course year after year and make our dreams come true. Nowhere was this faith more vividly expressed than in our National Day Parade. When we sang Majulah Singapura together as the flag flew past on a helicopter. When we “pledge ourselves as one united people… to achieve happiness, prosperity and progress for our nation”. This year’s Parade showed what Singapore can do. In the stories of our fellow Singaporeans, especially those who have overcome adversity, like our wheelchair basketballers. In the faces of the participants, radiant and happy, thrilled to be part of this shared story. In the response of the crowds, crowds at the Floating Platform, crowds around Marina Bay, crowds before TV screens and monitors all over Singapore in fact around the world. Watching them, feeling them, made me and my colleagues more determined to do the best for Singaporeans. They bolstered our conviction that it is worth doing and we can do it.
We may have made major shifts in our policies, but our core purpose has not changed. To create opportunities for Singaporeans, to fulfil their potential, do their best, to invest in every Singaporean and develop their innate talent, to keep Singapore a place where the human spirit thrives. We are not done building Singapore, we never will. Work with each other, work with us. Together, let us forge our new way forward. Together, let us build a better Singapore for all of us.Good night.

   singaporewebsite update april",14870,"In his 2013 National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outlined significant shifts in Singapore's policy direction, emphasizing the need for a strategic reorientation in response to both domestic challenges and global trends. Addressing the nation from the Institute of Technical Education College Central, PM Lee highlighted the importance of investing in every Singaporean's potential and adapting to rapid technological advancements and intense global competition.

PM Lee discussed the outcomes of the ""Our Singapore Conversation"" initiative, which engaged nearly 50,000 Singaporeans in discussions about the nation's future. The feedback underscored the public's desire for greater opportunities, assurance in basic needs, enhanced community spirit, and trust between the government and citizens.

In response to these aspirations, PM Lee announced major policy shifts in three key areas: housing, healthcare, and education. He detailed plans to make public housing more accessible and affordable, including adjustments to the CPF Housing Grants and the introduction of new housing categories. In healthcare, he introduced ""MediShield Life,"" a universal health coverage plan for all Singaporeans, emphasizing improved outpatient and inpatient subsidies and coverage for life.

Education reforms focused on reducing excessive competition by revising the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system and increasing flexibility in secondary education pathways. PM Lee also stressed the importance of keeping top schools open to diverse student backgrounds to maintain a meritocratic system.

These policy shifts represent a move towards a more inclusive society that balances individual responsibility with community and government support. PM Lee's speech reflects a commitment to adapting Singapore's successful development model to meet new challenges, ensuring that the nation continues to thrive amid changing global dynamics."

Singapore has come a long way. It is the work of generations, each standing on the shoulders of the one which came before and it started with one special generation – the Pioneer Generation (PG). And one outstanding member of the Pioneer Generation was Encik Yusof Ishak, our first President. Encik Yusof showed that in Singapore, you can rise to the top if you work hard. He stood for enduring values that underpin Singapore’s success – meritocracy, multiracialism, modernisation. He was a President for all Singaporeans. So, to mark SG50, as I said in my Malay speech, we will be honouring Encik Yusof in three ways. We are naming the new mosque in Woodlands Masjid Yusof Ishak. We are renaming the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies to ‘ISEAS -- The Yusof Ishak Institute’, and we are creating a ‘Yusof Ishak Professorship in Social Sciences’ in NUS.
Encik Yusof was not just a national leader, but he was also somebody you could get to know and get close to on a personal level. I first met him when I was seven years old. My family was on holiday up in Frasers Hill at Singapore House and Encik Yusof and his wife came up for a visit and brought toys for us children and I think I still remember that he gave me a little model aeroplane which would fly, powered by a rubber band, about 1959. I got to know the family better when he became Yang di-Pertuan Negara, when they stayed in the Istana grounds and I used to play with his son, Imran. In fact, it was Imran who taught me how to ride a bicycle on his bike. So several years later, when I won the President’s Scholarship, I was very honoured to receive it from Encik Yusof and we are very happy that Puan Noor Aishah is here and we are very happy that we have this opportunity to honour Encik Yusof for our 50th Anniversary.
Pioneer Generation Package
We are grateful to pioneers like Encik Yusof who sacrificed to build Singapore. Last year, I promised to make a meaningful gesture to thank every member of the Pioneer Generation still living. I thought carefully about how we should do this and decided to focus on healthcare. So we designed the Pioneer Generation Package or the PG Package and at Chinese New Year, we held a tribute party at the Istana and recently, a fortnight ago, we had a Pioneer Generation Card Launch Party at the People’s Association (PA) headquarters and I was very happy to see many old friends and colleagues. And I was inspired by those who came, like Dr Uma Rajan, who helped start the School Health Programme and produced the original version of the Child’s Health Booklet, which we still use today. I think nearly all of us here must have at least one of those booklets at home, some more than one generation’s worth of booklets.
Many other happy and heart-warming PG events all over Singapore. For example, these are the first Organising Secretaries in the People’s Association. They were the pioneer managers of our community centres in the 1960s and they were the frontline soldiers in the battle against communists and helped the Government to win the people’s support. And I am happy that a few of them are here today, including my old friend, Chan Seck Sung. Welcome!
The next group are the pioneer educators at Ministry of Education (MOE) Pioneer Tribute Dinner. They taught our children, they built up our education system and this young lady is Mrs Ambiavagar. She is holding up a letter of thanks from an ex-student and she is 100 years old this year. In Teck Ghee, for our National Day Dinner, we invited 50 tables of Pioneer Generation residents and this one is the Elvis Group singing “It’s Now or Never”. I am not going to sing this song, but you can see beside me my Singapore General Hospital (SGH) radiographer, Mr Ng Hon Weng, leading the charge and they are all having a great time. So tonight, besides my usual guests, I have invited 50 PG seniors to represent the 450,000 PG Singaporeans. So can I invite them as well as all the other pioneers who are here tonight, please to stand up. 建国前辈，请起立。Golongan Perintis silakan berdiri. Thank you. Thank you for all that you have done for Singapore.
Our pioneers were ordinary people who worked together to do extraordinary things. They overcame difficult and dangerous situations to build a sovereign, independent country. They transformed Singapore from Third World to First and they always looked to the future and strove to give their children better lives than themselves. And this is why we are commemorating SG50 next year, to celebrate the spirit of our pioneers and to commit ourselves to their enduring values as we make our way forward. I hope you will pen your hopes for the future in the ‘Wishing House’ at the SG50 booth later on.
Singapore is at a turning point. The world is in flux. Conflicts far away affect us. For example, in Ukraine, Russia’s annexation of Crimea showed us how important it is for countries to be able to defend themselves. And the recent MH17 tragedy shows us that even though Ukraine may be far away, its troubles can strike us uncomfortably close to home. It was sheer luck that there were no Singaporeans on that flight, but it could easily have been very different, and our condolences go to the families of all of the victims.
Nearer home, we see tensions in the South China Sea. The tensions are affecting sentiment in the region. It is affecting cooperation between countries. It is having an impact on confidence among businesses. It is even hardening attitudes among ordinary people towards other countries. And every foreign leader I meet asks me about the South China Sea. We are not a claimant, but we have upheld a clear position and that is to ask all the parties to exercise self-restraint in order to keep the region calm and avoid any mishaps.
There have been some positive political developments in Asia. There are new leaders, or there will be new leaders, in Indonesia and in India. Mr Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, has won the presidential elections in Indonesia and Mr Narendra Modi is the new Prime Minister in India. They enjoy strong public support, but their tasks are not easy. How their countries fare will affect the whole region, and I am looking forward to working with them and doing more with Indonesia and India.
Singapore is changing too. There is a new generation with new aspirations. There is the ageing population, which is creating new social needs. We have a better home, but we have the potential to do much, much more. Amidst these changes, Singaporeans ask ourselves, “How can I improve my life? What happens to me when I get old? Where will Singapore be in the future?” So as I said in my National Day Rally (NDR) last year, we are taking a new way forward, each one of us giving our best, and the Government and the community doing more to support individual efforts and, together, we create a brighter future for all of us.
We have made steady progress this last year. We have stabilised the housing market, we have cleared the HDB queue. We have settled the details of MediShield Life. We are keeping paths up open through education, including opening up the Primary One (P1) admission rules this year. We are expanding our public transport network. The Bus Service Enhancement Programme, the BSEP, has improved bus services. Members of Parliament (MPs) are asking for more buses, more services. For the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network, we have just announced the Thomson-East Coast Line a couple of days ago. So this year, I will focus on three topics – giving our people full opportunities to achieve their potential, providing Singaporeans more assurance in retirement, and making this Singapore, a home for all ages.

Singapore must always give our people full opportunities to achieve their potential.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
Singapore must always give our people full opportunities to achieve their potential. Our pioneers showed that we can do anything, provided we set our minds to it. And we must build on their legacy and continue to give every Singaporean the confidence to shoot for the stars. Education is an important part of this and that is why every year, I speak on different aspects of education and this year, I will focus on ITE (Institute of Technical Education) and Poly(technic) students. Our ITEs and Polys are world-class. Foreign visitors are amazed by the facilities, better than many universities. Investors are impressed by the quality of the graduates – well-trained, can-do, productive. And our students themselves are great examples of resolve, strength and character.
People, for example, like Divesh Singaraju, who was diagnosed with lymphoma when he was ten. He recovered, led a normal life. He fell in love with aeroplanes after visiting the cockpit of a SilkAir aircraft. He qualified for Junior College (JC), but decided to enrol in Singapore Polytechnic to pursue his passion for aeronautical engineering. Unfortunately, his cancer relapsed, which delayed his studies by a year, but he recovered, went back to school, this year graduated top of his class. And while he was there, he co-founded Youth Comm to help youths with cancer. He is going on to Imperial College to study aeronautical engineering on an SIA-SINDA scholarship and I wish him every success.
Or take William Tay. William lost his hearing to illness at four. He enrolled in ITE College Central here. He joined the Photography Club and the Deaf Dragons, which is a dragon boat racing team and he graduated last year with a NITEC in Info-Communications Technology with a perfect Grade Point Average (GPA) and won the Rotary-ITE Student Excellence Award. Welcome, William. Now, he is in the Poly, studying for a Diploma in Infocomm Security Management and benefiting from the Special Needs Education Fund, and working with his lecturers to come back to his alma mater to start a sign language Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) club here in ITE College Central.
So, we have done well by our students. But our students, having done well, naturally hope to climb even higher. And I give you an example of how they feel in this striking art work entitled “Aspirations” which has been put up by ITE students in their art show and if you go outside later, you will see it on the wall somewhere outside. And it shows their desire to improve themselves to reach the top and if you look carefully, you will see also it shows the right spirit because having reached the top, you reach down and help the next person to make it too. And I would say that this is a very good picture too because it shows that there are many paths up to the top which is, in fact, my theme tonight. They are right to aim high, we want to help them to create a brighter future for themselves by many routes, not just the academic route but also alternatively by getting good jobs, mastering deep skills, performing well and then getting relevant qualifications along the way, as they work, as they advance in their careers.
Keppel
Keppel Corp illustrates what we are trying to achieve. I visited Keppel’s Offshore and Marine (O&M) Shipyard at Tuas recently and talked to their people, both their management as well as the staff. I was deeply impressed, both by what they have achieved but also by their can-do spirit and confidence. In fact, their dry dock is called the “Fels Can-Do Dry Dock”. So, I went back again with a video crew to interview them, myself. So, let me share with you the story of two of the Keppelites, Dorothy Han and Abu Bakar.
Dorothy graduated from ITE and joined Keppel Fels as a draftsman about 25 years ago. She left Keppel, worked elsewhere, she came back to Keppel. She rose to lead the Pipe Design Section of the Engineering Department and with an ITE certificate, she is supervising 62 people in her department. So, I asked Dorothy how she came to join Keppel and here is her interview.
Ms Han: “Around 20 of us were being selected and we joined Keppel and that was started off with a trainee draftsman. We just know how to draw, that is all and from there, we get to know all sorts of experience and we even climb a ship and that was my very first time.”
PM: “It must be quite tough. You must put on a hard hat?”
Ms Han: “Yes, yes, for a lady and everybody was saying, you are a lady and why you have chosen so sweaty kind of job to come into a shipyard where it is very dirty and all that. But well, as what the Chinese saying and also my dad was also telling me 行行出状元.”
PM: “You went for training courses, what did the company do?”
Ms Han: “Currently, right now, I am with a sponsorship for a part-time Diploma.”
PM: “Diploma, with which Poly?”
Ms Han: “Yes, with Ngee Ann Poly because it was in a module structure, so it was actually in five modules. So, it takes two-and-half years.”
PM: “Tell us the modules.”
Ms Han: “For example, Certificates in Mechanics. Next year, I will be getting my, that is in my trade, which is Certificate in Piping System.”
PM: “That should be no problem.”
Ms Han: “I hope so.”
PM: “We are trying to encourage more girls to take up engineering and to consider careers like marine because people somehow think it is a man’s job. So, what can I tell them, or what can you tell them to persuade them that they are mistaken, it is not just a man’s job?”
Ms Han: “Over here, we are equal. If you can see that, if you can prove your capability, you can prove, you can take down so-called the responsibility, in fact, we are equal with all the men, yes.”
PM: “So, you are quite confident?”
Ms Han: “Everybody have the same opportunity.”
For the benefit of those of you who did not catch the Chinese words, Dorothy said行行出状元which means “in every profession, there is a top master”.
Abu Bakar graduated from Singapore Poly and then he joined Keppel Shipyard as an Assistant Safety Officer. Now he is working in Nakilat-Keppel Offshore and Marine, which is a joint venture shipyard Keppel did with a Qatar company in Qatar, specialising in solutions for gas carriers and offshore structures. I asked Bakar how long he had been in Qatar:
PM: “How long have you been there in Qatar?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “I have been there close to four years.”
PM: “What are you doing there? You are running the shipyard there?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Chief Executive Officer (CEO).”
PM: “So you are running the operation, you are in full control or you have to discuss with the Qatari Co-CEO?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “We are. There is no Co-CEO.”
PM: “Did you expect to be running a shipyard in Qatar when you joined Keppel?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “No, never.”
PM: “So, you went on training courses along the way?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Yes, Keppel gave me a lot of training. There is a lot of management courses training that they give. Only, in fact, recently, I just went through the Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA).”
PM: “With Singapore Management University (SMU)?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Yes, SMU.”
PM: “So, you did the EMBA, you have completed it already?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Yes, I have completed last year and it was quite a good programme, good exposure because I want to have an MBA that gives an Asian perspective as the programme itself brought you to Wharton, to China, Beijing, Hyderabad and also, of course, Singapore.”
PM: “You went into the programme; some of the other people on it must have already been graduates?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Yes, in fact, most of them.”
PM: “So did you feel you were able to cope equal with them or any difficulty because you have so many years of experience?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Yes, I think quite easy because it is quite relevant to our job in the EMBA and, in fact, to me it was very timely because you have a new company to run, because is it totally a new start-up yard. You run there, you run a new business.”
PM: “So, you were applying in your work what you were learning on the EMBA?”
Mr Abu Bakar: “Yes, that is why I said quite timely because I used the course as the platform for me to discuss my problems.”
PM: “You get free consultancy.”
Mr Abu Bakar: “They have 30 over people to consult with. So, it was quite, very timely, seriously, very timely because that is where you ask the lecturer the real life difficulty that you have and I really appreciate that.”
I would like to make two points on Bakar. First, he did not have a degree, he had a Poly Diploma. The eMBA needed a degree to start. So, Keppel, Mr Choo Chiau Beng, wrote a letter to SMU vouching for Bakar’s experience and capabilities and SMU accepted that and took him in and he did well on the course. So, the employer support is very important. Secondly, Bakar is a good National Serviceman (NS) man. I first met him when he was commissioned in the old Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI) parade square 25 years ago on his commissioning parade and I was very happy to discover on the day I interviewed him, that was the day he was being promoted to full Colonel (NS), commanding an infantry brigade.
So, Keppelites like Dorothy and Abu Bakar can advance because Keppel O&M values every worker and the tone is set from the top over many years by leaders like Mr Choo Chiau Beng and sustained by the current Keppel leadership. So, well done, Keppel! Keppel illustrates that you can progress by acquiring deep skills and knowledge throughout your career and there are different ways to deepen your skills and knowledge, by learning on the job or by going for higher qualifications as you work, and progressively, or both. And you should look for the best ways to learn, learn what is relevant, apply that. Do not go on a paper chase for qualifications or degrees, especially if they are not relevant because pathways and opportunities to upgrade and to get better qualifications will remain open throughout your career. It is never the last chance. You always have the possibility to advance, to improve yourself, to take another step as long as you are working, as long as your mind remains fresh and active and you dare to go.
At the same time, employers must value your staff and develop them to take on higher responsibilities and with the right support at work, you can advance in your careers, whether or not you are a graduate. And this is the culture shift which we need and that is why I set up the ASPIRE (Applied Study in Polytechnics and ITE Review) Committee chaired by Indranee Rajah to study how to create and widen and strengthen this work-and-study path. So, Indranee’s committee will announce its recommendations shortly, but just very broadly, we need to help students make better education and career decisions, so they know the full range of choices before they decide. We should help poly and ITE graduates get into jobs for which they were trained and have the right skills because very often, they do courses, they come up well-qualified in engineering or in building management or in design or in childcare and then, they go and do something completely which is not related.
We have to help individuals to progress and upgrade after they have graduated and started work in their careers to develop the structured career paths for them and then to implement this work and study path on a national scale. It is not easy. It involves multiple stakeholders, many government agencies -- education, manpower, trade and industry. It involves employers, companies who have to develop and value every worker and create the corporate values, the cultures, the training systems within the companies. Not easy for big companies, even harder for SMEs. We need the unions in this because you have to be fully behind the effort, championing lifelong learning like what you are doing in the Devan Nair Institute.
So, within the Government, the natural agency to take the lead in doing this is an expanded WDA, Workforce Development Agency. But the WDA will need strong support from other agencies, employers and unions. So, to bring all the pieces together, I have asked DPM Tharman to lead a tripartite committee which will involve the Government, employers and unions, to drive this and to develop an integrated system of education, training and progression for all Singaporeans and promote industry support and social recognition for individuals to advance based on their skills.
The Government, as a public service, as an employer, we will do our part. The Civil Service does offer fulfilling careers to non-graduates. For example, in the People’s Association, there is a single scheme of service, whether you are a graduate whether you are a diploma holder, you join the same scheme of service, you join at different points, but after that, your advance is based on merit and there have been many non-graduates who have progressed to senior manager positions based on their ability to do the job well.
Another area where we have many opportunities for developing these careers are in nursing. Many of our senior nurses started off without a degree, worked their way up, some of them have earned degrees along the way, but as a nurse, we assess you on your knowledge, on your ability, on your commitment and not so much on where you started. We have recently enhanced the pay and careers for the nursing profession and I hope that this will help the nurses to upgrade and progress.
The SAF, too, recognises leadership abilities, not just academic qualifications, and there are many paths upward for non-graduates and military experts and as COL (NS) Bakar’s example shows, you do not need a degree to be a good commander. So the public service can and will do more. We will put more weight on job performance and relevant skills, rather than starting qualifications. We will merge more graduate and non-graduate schemes to give everyone the same opportunities on the same career track and we will promote non-graduates more quickly to what used to be considered graduate level jobs, once they prove that they can do it.
But to succeed nationally, we need two strategic factors which will help everyone to achieve their potential. One, you must have economic growth to create opportunities for our workers to rise. Keppel can offer opportunities and create career pathways because it is a successful company. Likewise, for Singapore, our economy must be competitive too. Companies have to be able to prosper, investments must still want to come to Singapore. We must have growth in order to look after our people well. So, we have to be hard-headed in order to be good-hearted.
Secondly, and just as importantly, we need a cultural change because fundamentally, this is about our values, about how we value people, and Singapore must always be a place where everyone can feel proud of what they do, where you are respected for your contributions and your character and anyone can improve his life if he works hard and everyone can hope for a better future.
There is one more Keppelite who personifies this story and he is Roy Lim. He left school after Secondary Two. He started out working as an apprentice in Far East Levingston Shipyard which later on became Keppel FELS, and he started working 37 years ago. With support from Keppel, he completed NTC 3 and then NTC 2 and today, he is one of two shipyard managers of Keppel FELS and the two of them together manage Keppel’s two biggest shipyards in Tuas and have 12,000 people under their charge. And Roy said, “I can never imagine someone like me with no education can rise to be a shipyard manager.” Here is my interview with him.
PM: “You have been with the company all over, right, many departments and also overseas?”
Mr Lim: “Oh yes, yes.”
PM: “You were in China?”
Mr Lim: “I was in China, I was in Vietnam, I was in India, I was in Holland, I was inFinland. Finland is the one that is terrible.”
PM: “Why?”
Mr Lim: “Because I am alone.”
PM: “Oh.”
Mr Lim: “Alright, and I have got to deal with the Russians and the Finns. I was there as a warranty engineer for the multi-purpose vessel, so I need to engage interpreters to communicate with them and I realise that there’s one day when I was alone in the evening, actually, I wanted to go for my dinner, so I popped into a restaurant. I popped into a restaurant and the guy chased me out. You know what he said? ‘You are Vietnamese. You are not allowed to come in’. I looked at the guy, I was stunned for a while, then I gave a thought. I take out, ‘I’m a Singaporean.’ I take out my passport and they allowed me to go in.”
PM: “Oh. So, a powerful passport.”
Mr Lim: “A powerful passport, seriously.”
PM: “So, you didn’t think of giving up?”
Mr Lim: “Never gave up. Later, I think about it already, then I want to give up. I have this problem, I try to solve, I can’t solve, okay and actually, I called my wife. I said, ‘I want to give up.’ I said it’s very tough for me, it’s all on my own, there’s no support from Singapore. If you are in Singapore, you are very comfortable because if you have any problems, you just ‘beep, beep, beep’, everybody will come to attend to it.”
PM: “Yes, indeed.”
Mr Lim: “So I called my wife and said, ‘I want to give up.’ Then my wife told me, ‘Don’t give up. Finish the job. Even though you want to quit, finish the job and come back with your head high. So that at least you fulfil your obligation.’ But my wife told me one thing, ‘Don’t worry about family. Let me take care of the kids. You concentrate on your work.’ That will actually ease me a lot of things. So, I continued to finish the job.”
Thank you, Roy, for being a role model and thank you, Mrs Lim, for standing by your husband through difficult times. There are many other Roy Lims and Mrs Lims in Singapore. They may not have degrees, but they are working hard and trying to improve themselves. So long as you work hard, you can always hope for a brighter future here in Singapore.
Besides creating hope for the future, we must also give assurance to those in need, especially our seniors. By and large, seniors in Singapore are doing well. Many have savings and investments. Some are happily working, others are getting good support from their children and we have good schemes to provide assurance in retirement and the CPF (Central Provident Fund) scheme and home ownership are the twin pillars of our retirement adequacy.
Home ownership is critical. The Government has worked hard to help Singaporeans own their homes. Therefore, Singapore is not just a place to live, but a home. But just as importantly, this home, your home, is a valuable nest egg when you retire. Singaporeans may not fully appreciate this, but many have significant savings in their flats. So, if you look at a typical retiree household living in a three-room flat, he has got $300,000 worth of savings in his flat. A four-room retiree household typically has $400,000 worth of savings in his flat. It is a valuable little pot of gold to draw on if they need to. That is home ownership.
The CPF has also served us well and there are three good things about the CPF. Firstly, it has personal responsibility because with the CPF scheme, the more you work, the longer you work, the more you save and the more you will have in retirement. Secondly, the CPF scheme is fair. Your savings are for your own retirement, not for someone else’s. Thirdly, with CPF Life, this is for life because CPF Life will pay you a stream of income as long as you live.
The CPF has been in the news recently because this year, we adjusted the minimum sum, increased it to $155,000 for those who are turning 55 this year and there were some reactions and some people say they want all of their CPF money back. Like the Chinese lady who spoke to Teo Ser Luck just now, whom I told you about just now. She wanted it back for herself, but not for her husband. But she is not the only one. Hri Kumar held a dialogue on CPF and he had one participant saying ‘Give me back my CPF. I want to spend it all.’ So Hri Kumar, who is a very mild man, says “Then who will take care of you if your money runs out?” So the participant said, “God will help me.” But another participant put his hand up and said, “What he means is that the Government will help him”.
But other people have a more balanced view. Sim Ann held a dialogue. She had a volunteer who put his hand up and pointed out how your CPF savings come about and why that was the wrong perspective and let me take you through Sim Ann’s volunteer’s argument. This is the CPF logo. You have all seen it, but if you look carefully, you will see that it has got three keys inside it and the three keys represent the three parties who have come together in order to make the CPF system and provide this social security for you.
Who are the three parties? One is yourself because when you work, you earn salary. From the salary, you pay your employee’s CPF. The second key is your employer, because the employer pays into the CPF, into your CPF, the employer’s CPF contribution over and above your wages because the Government required them by law to do it. So the third key is ‘zheng hu’ - the Government. The Government made this system, the Government set the rules. The Government also tops up directly into the CPF of many Singaporeans. How do we do that? We give you housing grants when you buy a HDB flat. Many people will get a housing grant. We give you Medisave top-ups. When you get your GST voucher, there is a Medisave top-up in there. When the finances are good and the Minister for Finance has a good Budget, you may get the Medisave top-up. You get Workfare because if you are a low-income worker, in your Workfare, a big contribution goes automatically into your CPF every month to help you save for your retirement. So together, the three of these – you, your employer, your Government – have set up the CPF for a common purpose and that common purpose is to set up a nest egg for you for your retirement.
What is this nest egg for? It is not for you to take out the whole lump sum at once. It is for you to be able to draw out a steady stream of income from the CPF in old age. It is to give you old age security.
Minimum Sum
So the question is, how much money do we need to keep in the CPF to get this income stream?’. And the answer is the Minimum Sum, the MS, and for the group which is turning 55 this year, the MS is $155,000. Seems like a big sum. It is far from excessive and let me show you, through an example, why I do not think that it is excessive.
Last year, I was your real estate agent. This year, the real estate market is no good, I have upgraded myself, I have become a financial planner. Okay, as a financial planner, I was sitting in my office. Mr and Mrs Tan came to consult me. They are reaching 55, they have to make decisions on their CPF and their retirement plans, so they came to ask me to talk through their options. Let me show you.
Here is Mr Tan. He is 54-plus years old. He is a senior technician and he earns $4,500 per month. His wife, Mrs Tan, is a housewife, about the same age. I did not ask the wife’s age, but about the same. They have two kids. The son has finished NS (National Service), going to university now. Daughter still in school. So the household income is not bad, $4,500 per month, and they are living in a four-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. You can see the flat there, I think they are on the fifth floor, fully paid-up, $450,000 worth of a flat. So this is the Tan family now.
Now, I said to Mr Tan, “Think about it. In ten years’ time, your children will have grown up, finished studying, working, perhaps married. You will still be working, you could be on the point of retiring, but your expenses will be less in retirement, so you will not need the same income as now”. So I asked Mr Tan, “How much do you think you will need in retirement every month? What will we need?” So he thought about it.
While he thinks about it, let me ask you what you think he needs. What do you think? $3,000 per month? That is about two-thirds what he is getting now. $2,000 per month? Half, less than half what he is getting now or $1,000 per month, which is less than a quarter of the current income.
Let us have a show of hands, we decide for the Tans. Who says he needs $3,000 per month? Upstairs, nobody puts hands up. Okay, who says he needs $2,000 a month, enough? Oh, this is more. Okay, who says $1,000 enough? Old people do not spend much money. Nobody. Okay, so I take it that you think he needs about $2,000 a month, right? Which was what Mr Tan said too, after thinking it over. Now, just as well.
So let me ask you this, which is what Mr Tan asked me. To get $2,000 a month from the age of 65 for the rest of his life, how much money do you think he must put into the CPF now and lock up so that 65 years old, he can start drawing $2,000 a month? So Mr Tan did not know the answer, but I had a calculator. CPF has these things and they did the sums. So I looked up the answer and the answer is he needs $250,000 now when he is 55 years old in order to get what he wants if it is all to come from the CPF, $2,000 a month, and I do not have to tell you, but this is more than the MS, which is only $155,000.
So I told Mr Tan this. He looked a bit disappointed. He says, “I don’t have $155,000.” So I said, “Well, you own a house, right?” He said yes. So I said the CPF lets you count your house in the MS, so the house can make up half the MS and then you only need to put in $77,500 of cash in the CPF. If you want, you can take the rest out and then you will have made up your full MS – half property, half cash. So he brightened up. He said, “Ah. $75,000, no problem. I can take some money out now, go on holiday with my wife.”
Then I said, “I have not finished the sum. A quarter million, you get $2,000. $77,500, if you only leave $77,500 in the CPF, you will get out of the CPF, how much do you think? All of $600 per month. So if you need $2,000, this is not going to be enough and you have to think of some other sources of income when you reach 65.” So he stopped planning his holiday. He asked me, “So what can I do?” I said, “Well, you have several options. First, you could continue working because ten years’ time, most likely, we are working with NTUC, we should have raised the re-employment age beyond 65 and if you are still healthy, I would strongly encourage you to continue working.”
“Secondly, your children will be working and they may help to support you. I hope so because we teach them that in school. Thirdly, you can draw on your personal savings. You told me you had some POSB account savings. So that is for a rainy day and for old age. Or you can get some money out of your house.”
So Mr Tan says now, “Okay, how do I do that?” So, I said, “Well, there are several ways you can take money out of your house. You could rent out one room. You post an ad on propertyguru.com. One room in Ang Mo Kio, how much do you think? $1,000. Well, I told him conservatively, you can get $700 a month. That is per month, steady income. Or if you are going to move in with your children, your children have married, you can move in with them, you can rent out the whole flat and how much do you think can get renting out the whole flat? In fact, you can check up the answer in The Straits Times because the HDB publishes the data. Ang Mo Kio four-room flat, currently at $2,500 per month. Not bad.”
“The third thing you could do is you could right-size. What does right-sizing mean? Right- sizing means you sell this flat, you buy a smaller flat. Let us say you buy a studio apartment, you move into the studio apartment and then in the process you can enjoy a Silver Housing Bonus from the Government which is $20,000 and if you do this, we can do the sums, you will get quite a lot of money. $210,000 plus $800 per month. $800 per month is additional income. It is on top of what CPF Life was going to pay you.”
So, Mr Tan says, “Wow, it sounds good.” Then he got a bit carried away, he says, “If I am going to live with my daughter, why don’t I just sell my flat outright, I will get even more money?” So, I said, “Well, I encourage you to stay with your children, but I would advise you to think very, very carefully before you sell your flat because I have seen so many sad cases – seniors cashed out unwisely, cheated of all their money, sometimes even turfed out by their children. Quarrel with their children, quarrel with the in-laws. So, it is better if you keep your property. Even if you rent out the whole flat, it does not matter, it is yours, and you can fall back on it for your old age, just in case anything happens.”
So, he paused again, then he asked me a new question. He says, “My neighbour, 3-room, he just turned 65, he is a bit older than me, he did a lease buyback with HDB, how does that work?” So, I said, “Sorry, lease buyback not for you. Lease buyback (is for) 3-room, yours 4-room, cannot.” So, he says, “Never mind, assuming can then how?” So, I said “Okay, if you really want to know let me explain to you but remember, cannot.”
“So, here is how it works. You bought this flat when you got married and it came with a 99-year lease, looks very long. So, this line is a 99-year lease on your flat. You have lived in it since then. Now quarter-century. In ten years’ time, you will be 65 years-old and you will still have this long lease left. In fact, the long lease left is about 65 years. So, I think when you are 65, you probably are not going to live in this house for another 65 years, right?” So, he said, “Okay”. So, I said, “well, let us say you live in this house for another 30 years, then you really do not need the rest of the lease beyond that. You only need these 30 years. So, this part, you can sell to HDB and HDB will buy back from you. That is why it is called the lease buyback. And if they buy it back from you, then they will shorten your lease and then they will give you some money.” So, he says, “How much?” So, we did the sums. Assuming he can get it, well, he gets $27,500 plus $900 per month and again, this is on top of what he gets from CPF. It is not quite as much cash as if he is right-sizing, but that is because he can continue to stay in the same flat and he can even rent out the room in the flat if he wants. But I said, sorry, yours is 4-room, so no lease buyback. So, Mr Tan says, “Oh, what a pity. Can I see my MP or not to appeal for a lease buyback?” So, I told him “sure, your MP, I think this is Lee Hsien Loong, Block 322 Avenue 3, and every Wednesday night at 8.00pm”. And that is how my advisory session ended and next thing I knew, I saw Mr Tan at my MPS.
So, actually, what Mr Tan wanted, which is to have the lease buyback for 4-room flats, many other Singaporeans also want. Last year, we held the Our Singapore Conversation and there many seniors who were living in larger flats asking for lease buyback because they felt that right-sizing, moving to a studio apartment, taking the Silver Housing Bonus, they are all attractive options, but they still preferred to grow old in the comfort of their own homes and I can fully understand that. The surroundings are familiar, your old friends are around you, your neighbours, you have known them for so long. You do not want to uproot yourself, move somewhere else unfamiliar, set up and then have to establish your networks and your links all over again. So HDB has studied this carefully and I am happy to tell you, as well as Mr and Mrs Tan if they are still watching that we will extend the Lease Buyback scheme to 4-room flats and this will cover more than half of all flat-owners in Singapore.
Now, Mr and Mrs Tan are not a real family, but the Tans’ profile is quite typical of many HDB households. And even if your own circumstances are not quite the same as the Tans’, the general conclusion from this is still valid and what is the general conclusion from this case? First of all, the CPF and your house go hand in hand to provide for your retirement. If you have both of them, then you should have one happy couple. Secondly, the current Minimum Sum, $155,000, is not too much. Thirdly, which I think many Singaporeans do not realise, if you own a house, you only need to set aside half of the MS and that is only $77,500. Let me have a show of hands, how many of you knew all this before I explained this to you? Wow, more and more hands, but I think honestly, not all of us know and I would say even not all the MPs are completely familiar.
So, finally, if you have a house, then you have many options to get money out of the house. You can rent, you can right-size, you can (do a) lease buyback, but whichever way you go, you probably will get the lump sum and some income. So, because these are fundamental simple points, I made a summary pamphlet with Mr and Mrs Tan inside to put this all out and you can pick up your copy later after my speech.
So, the CPF scheme is good, but it can be improved. It works well for most Singaporeans but not quite for all especially the lower income and also, it is not quite flexible enough and I think we can and should improve the scheme further. First of all, we should help the lower-income Singaporeans. With the CPF and HDB for the majority of the population you can save enough for your retirement. But for a minority, 10, 20 per cent, I think even if they are working, they may not accumulate enough CPF during their working lives. Some of them may not have bought an HDB flat, some may have no family support to fall back on and in their case these individual efforts will not be enough. So, the Government and the society must help to do more, must do more to help them in their retirement. So, for this group, we should supplement their payouts from their own CPF savings with bonus payments from the Government, just the same way as we have Workfare to supplement the wages of low-income workers. So, we should have a new scheme for low-income elderly, actually, they are just poor elderly because no more income, but they are poor, they are elderly and we should call this scheme, the Silver Support Scheme.
What should the Silver Support Scheme do? We should pay a bonus every year starting from the age of 65, something extra to help the old folks with their living expenses with the cost of living. It comes from the Government, not from their own savings. It is on top of all the other Government and community support which the old people already receive and it is part of the new way forward that I spoke about last year. We are doing this, the Government is helping this group of Singaporeans, but personal responsibility remains important even while the community and the Government plays a larger role. I am not going into details today. We will announce the details at the Budget next year.
The second thing we should do with the CPF scheme is to increase flexibility, to make it more flexible. There are two views of the purpose of the CPF funds. One view is, I want to be assured of a steady stream of income in old age, but the other view is, I want a lump sum now because I need money urgently. Now, my view is that the core purpose of the CPF should still be to provide a steady stream of income in old age, but I appreciate why some CPF members want to take more money out because they have been saving up over a lifetime of work, they want to use some of these savings, they want to do something they have longed wanted to do, some lifetime ambition. They may want to go on a journey, they may want go on a haj. Or maybe they have run into some family emergency and need money to deal with the emergency.
So, after considering this for a long time and discussing it with my colleagues, I have decided I would change my view, I would adjust the policy and I think we should allow people the option to take out part of their CPF savings in a lump sum if they need to but subject to some limits. The amount which you can take out cannot be excessive. For example, it can be up to 20 per cent of the total that you have and it should only be during retirement, 65 and beyond, not ‘suka suka’, any time you need money, you visit the HDB. He is not your money lender. This is for retirement. We provide this flexibility but members must understand clearly the trade-offs because if you take out the lump sum, that means you will have less left in the CPF and your monthly payments will also be less. So, that is a second thing we should do, make the CPF more flexible, and have the possibility of a controlled lump sum withdrawal in retirement.
But there is one more outstanding issue on the CPF and that is how much should the MS be over the longer term? We have been adjusting the MS over the last ten years, the Minimum Sum, because the old number was much too low and gradually, over ten years, we have been raising it to the current $155,000 and there is one final instalment in this adjustment. Next year – and people have been asking what that will be – and I will tell you that we will decide now that for next year, the number will be $161,000 for people who are turning 55 from July 1 next year. So it is $155,000 now, it will go up a little bit up to $161,000 but if you have the property pledge, you will only need half of this and that is $80,500. It is a necessary step, but it does not change the overall picture much. Next year, if I am still a financial adviser and Mr Tan’s younger brother comes to me for advice, the sums will be more or less the same as for Mr Tan. Beyond this I do not see the need for any more major increases in the MS, but we will still need to adjust the MS from time to time because incomes will go up, so basic spending needs will increase. People are living longer and we need to provide more money for a longer retirement. Therefore, we need to build more flexibility into the CPF system and give CPF members more choices.
I have sketched a couple of key points but there are a few more important issues to consider. For example, how should we adjust the Minimum Sum beyond next year, so that members can continue to get an adequate basic retirement payout? What should be the rules and the limits for taking up the lump sum? How can members have more flexibility to invest their CPF savings, to accept more risks in the hope of higher returns? And for members who prefer payouts to rise over time, because we would like to be able to cope with future rises in the cost of living, how can we offer members options to do that because there is a trade-off? There is a finite amount of money. If you want more later on in the later years, it means that you have to have less earlier on in the earlier years and some may prefer to do that, some may prefer not to. So how can we offer members a good choice to do this? Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has worked out some possibilities, but CPF changes are very complicated. So we are going to set up an advisory panel to study all this and MOM will announce details about the panel soon.
So the CPF and home ownership provide for our needs when we retire. They are good schemes, they work well for the majority of Singaporeans, but they are not one-size-fits-all policies. They offer different choices for people in different circumstances. But we are going to improve them further so that we can better support lower-income elderly who need more help and we will make it more flexible so as to meet the needs of more Singaporeans and give you greater assurance and more options in retirement.

We want Singapore to be the best place to live, work and play.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
We want Singapore to be the best place to live, work and play. We want this to be an outstanding city, well-planned, well-run, offering a high quality of life, full of buzz and vibrancy. We want this to be our cherished home where we grow our roots, build emotional bonds and form new fond memories. We want this to be a special red dot for all Singaporeans. In the last 49 years, our physical transformation has been remarkable. Our Singaporean identity is strengthening, but keeping Singapore special is a journey without end. We will work with Singaporeans to improve on what we have.
Outstanding City
One area where we can do better is getting all our different agencies to work more closely together, especially when their responsibilities overlap with one another or are split between different agencies and I have highlighted funny examples of inter-agency issues before. For example, it used to be if you saw a snake, then which agency to call depends on which way the snake is pointing and going. Now, there is one agency, AVA, in charge of all snakes as well as other animals.
So we have made some progress, especially after we highlight vivid examples, we have a good laugh and then we sort it out, but we have not arrived. So to prepare for this speech, I asked the MPs to give me some recent examples. So tonight, I have decided Mayor Low Yen Ling wins the lucky draw. Yen Ling’s residents had complained that the walkway to Bukit Gombak MRT Station was often dirty. One resident told her he saw a fishball stick there on the walkway. The next day, he came back, he looked, and the same fishball stick was still in the same place. Her residents have very sharp eyes. So Yen Ling called up the agencies to find out why the area was not being cleared regularly and she had to make multiple calls to several agencies, held several meetings, finally, she managed to establish what happened and here is what she found.
Listen very carefully. On the left of the walkway is a slope. The slope belongs to NEA, okay? In the middle, this is a park connector, park connector, 顾名思义 - you think of the name, belongs to NParks. On the right-hand side is a pavement. Pavement is next to the road, road comes under LTA. So the fishball stick was on the road side and the road side was only cleared every two days because each of the organisations had their own cleaner, own schedules and they did it separately. So I do not think it makes a lot of sense and everybody has agreed and we have resolved this case. From now on, NEA ‘bao ga liao’ (is in charge of all three sectors).
So Yen Ling did her job as a Mayor, but she found it a frustrating and difficult experience, even though she is a Mayor. So can you imagine if you are an ordinary citizen trying to solve such a problem and running around the different agencies? So it is not the way we should be operating and we have to do better to bridge these inter-agency boundaries and to serve the public in an integrated way.
Many cities encounter these problems. Some of them have gone into ops centres to report and monitor municipal issues, like Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. They have a very modern ops centre, looks like a NASA command post and all the emergency services, all the key public agencies report to it. They have cameras all-round the city, you see the screens, they can monitor what is happening. It is manned by 50 officers and they can give commands and make things happen if there is a disaster. If there is an accident, they can divert traffic. If it rains heavily, there is a risk of landslides, because a lot of their slums live on steep hill slopes, they can sound the sirens, warn people and during the World Cup, they found this ops centre very useful.So we need to get there also and we will set up a Municipal Services Office (MSO) – one authority to coordinate all of the agencies: LTA, PUB, NParks, the whole lot, and single-mindedly focus on service delivery. I am going to put it in MND, but I will appoint Minister Grace Fu to oversee this Municipal Services Office, working with Minister Khaw Boon Wan. So more details will be announced later, please be patient. We are going in the right direction. We are determined to do better and I think Grace will do a good job.
Smart Nation
While the Government will try to do a better job with the MSO, please do not make their job too difficult. Citizens also have a role to play to make this our better home. For a start, please do not drop fishball sticks and then we will not have to spend so much effort cleaning up after you. But you can also be a part of the solution, being our eyes and ears all over Singapore, and we can use technology to crowd-source, to involve Singaporeans so that you can give feedback, you can report incidents, problems on the ground and already, we have some apps to do that. For example, Ang Mo Kio Town Council, my own, has iConnect to report estate maintenance issues and residents take a picture, they send the picture in, town council deals with it and then you get a message back soon saying ‘Done’ or ‘Being fixed’ or ‘On the way’. LTA has a MyTransport app, so you can provide information on bus arrivals, parking lots, traffic jams.
NEA has a new app, myENV. I was going to demonstrate it to you, but to save time, I will just tell you about it. You should go and see, it is a very good app. It is newly-updated and it gives you information on the PSI, if there is a haze, on dengue. You can see it gives you information, PSI 51, dengue-something, water level, in case there is a flash flood somewhere and the tides and it also lets you report issues on the ground. For example, litter. Here is a report which somebody has sent in about litter and there is a photograph, you can have an address there and the status, it has been submitted. Then if you submit it, NEA will work with the agencies, resolve it and let you know once it is done.
All these apps are free. So please download them, use them, but one request, please do not send your selfies to them. This is to help us to do more with technology, with IT. In fact, I wanted to show you a lot more about technology and IT tonight. Our tech people have been doing a lot of work. There are many applications, many gadgets in our plans to make Singapore a Smart Nation - not just to run the place better, but so that it can make a difference to people’s lives, to patients, to commuters, to students, to households and there are many ways we can do this. There is an exhibition outside in the auditorium. You can take a look at it later, but there is so much to cover. I have decided to put this aside so that I can do justice to the subject properly and I am going to find an opportunity later on to talk about our Smart Nation plans
Best Home
But, tonight, I want to go on and talk about making this our best home and that goes beyond running our city better or using technology more because it is about making every corner of Singapore an outstanding living environment.
Last year, I talked about our plans to develop Changi, Paya Lebar, Tanjong Pagar, move the port to Tuas and these are going to happen over the next 20, 30 years. They are long-term plans, but they are acts of faith in our future. Meanwhile, we are already making our island a beautiful home. From time to time, I take a staycation in Singapore. Instead of going anywhere, I stay at home. I visit parts of Singapore which I do not get a chance to visit at work on duty and take a walk with my wife. Pretty places, interesting places, always find something interesting and once in a while, I snap a picture and share it on Facebook and let me show you some of the things:
Marina Bay - dressed up for a New Year countdown. MacRitchie - not many of you have been here. This is a treetop walk, the suspension bridge. Quite exciting. Vigorous walk, but well worth the effort. Lower Seletar Reservoir at sunset - very peaceful, good for lovers as well as other residents. Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park - very popular. You can see people on the bridge. This is the Bishan side, the Ang Mo Kio side is just as good, but I thought tonight I should show Bishan. Jurong Lake - at sunset.
Jurong Lake District
Jurong used to be swamps. We filled up the swamps, built factories, transformed Jurong into an industrial town. We created jobs for Singaporeans, but we also built Jurong Lake and the Chinese Gardens and the Japanese Gardens and we have been upgrading Jurong over the years, recently as Jurong Lake District in 2008.
Jurong Lake District comes in two pieces. One piece is at Jurong Gateway, here, and one piece is the Lakeside. This one (Gateway) is commercial business, this one (Lakeside) is more residential and also greenery. The Gateway has already been transformed. I sent a drone up to take this picture - a UAV, and just to orientate you, we are looking westwards, you can see the MRT line going. This one - you can just see this is the Chinese Garden MRT station, this one is the Jurong East MRT Station. This is the Big Box. This one is the IMM for shopping. This is Westgate. This is the Devan Nair Institute, open on May Day. This one, not quite completed, is Ng Teng Fong Hospital General Hospital. It was supposed to be completed by December, but unfortunately, there are construction delays, so the opening is pushed back by about six months, but we are getting there.
So you can see that Jurong Gateway is already transformed, but there should be more to Jurong than shopping malls and industries. Jurong also includes the Lakeside, the Chinese Garden here, and the Japanese Garden here. So I visited them in June on leave. And they are very beautiful. Japanese Gardens - serene, peaceful. I think there is a marble bridge - traditional design, links you across to the Chinese side. And this is the Chinese side with pretty pavilions and pagodas. So it is very nice and yet, I felt the last time I was here was nearly 30 years ago and it looks about the same. It is also under-utilised, quite unlike Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, where there are thousands of people every day. This one - very few visitors and I felt we could do so much more with the gardens. So I asked the planners to consider bringing it all together to do a more ambitious transformation of the whole area and the planners came back to me and said, “Yes, we have been thinking along the same lines. Here are some interesting ideas, ideas for the garden, ideas for the living environment, ideas for the surrounding towns.”
You know where the Japanese Garden is? You know where the Chinese Garden is? On the west side of the lake, there is Jurong Lake Gardens or Jurong Lake Park and they are really three different pieces. But if we bring them all together, we can redesign the whole area. You can change the islands, you might merge them. You can change the shape of the lake, which is right now a little bit awkward. You can create one beautiful set of gardens in our heartlands and that can be Jurong Lake Gardens and can be something really special. For example, it can be the focal point for the Community in Bloom movement. There are many Community in Bloom groups all over Singapore. Passionate, enthusiastic, they take great pride in their gardens. They beautify their neighbourhoods, they spruce up their environment, they have spice gardens downstairs, fruit gardens, flower beds and they submit outstanding entries to the Singapore Garden Festival. This one for example is a little Smurf garden, you can just see the Smurfs and there is a little Smurfette down there learning to walk. This is from previous years. But this year I have a picture - this is a winning entry from this year’s Garden Festival which is currently on. This entry is called “Scent-alising” - scent meaning the perfume, the aroma. And it has been put up by community groups and schools from Southeast District and it won the NParks Community in Bloom Gardens Cup Education Award this year. So, you can see the kids are thoroughly enjoying the scent garden. I am going to visit (the Singapore Garden Festival) this week after completing this NDR and I think you should go and visit the place too. But this is the sort of thing which you can do in Jurong Lake Gardens. Bring community gardeners from all over Singapore to create and look after show gardens in the Jurong Lake Gardens, make it the People’s Garden - bigger than Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park even perhaps better than Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. Next year, NParks will invite design ideas, so please give us your ideas. These are your gardens; we want to hear from you.
But Jurong Lake Gardens is not just a thing in itself. It is like Paya Lebar Airport which I told you about last year. You move Paya Lebar Airport, you not only free up Paya Lebar, you also enable development all around the eastern part of the island. So similarly with Jurong Lake Gardens if we do a good job of that and integrate it with the neighbourhood, we can transform a big part of the western part of Singapore. What are the things you can do? Well, you can connect Jurong, this by the way is Jurong East MRT Station which I showed you just now - just so you can orientate yourself. But what can you do? You can connect up the gardens to our park connector network island-wide. So that you can walk there from many places. You can connect it up to our ABC Waters Programme, up and down the Jurong River. You can have housing around the gardens. There is already housing around it, you can see the dark orange pieces - we are going to build more further north like here. Further south there are these purple bits, which are currently industrial plots. Further down near Pandan Reservoir here and the leases on the industrial plots will run out over the next 20, 30 years and as they run out we can build housing there and integrate it into the Lake District. I know those of you who are familiar with the area are thinking, ‘all these sounds good but right now there are too many traffic jams’. But we are working on it, we are increasing, improving the capacity of our North-South and East-West Lines and we should see improvements in the North-South and East-West Lines over the next two years. Later on we are building the Jurong Region Line and the Cross-Island Line. So, you can see this is the Jurong Region Line which covers Jurong and the Cross-Island Line which will come all the way across here. It will take some time but it will come.
For the longer term there are even bolder possibilities. The AYE (Ayer Rajah Expressway) is now along here. It is really too close to the gardens. It constricts the gardens. If we can move the AYE down south, then you free up space next to the lake, you can build more lakeside housing. It will be like living in Bishan or Ang Mo Kio along Avenue 1 or living in Punggol along the waterway.
One day the High Speed Rail may come to Jurong. I have agreed with Prime Minister Najib to build a High Speed Rail between Singapore and KL (Kuala Lumpur). And I have told PM Najib that in Singapore why don’t we site the terminus in the Jurong Lake District. So we are discussing with the Malaysians, we have not settled this yet but if we get a High Speed Rail terminus in the Jurong Lake District than that will make Jurong truly an exciting gateway to Singapore.
So, we can transform the whole area and the Lake Gardens will be the crown of Jurong Lake District and we will place one jewel in the crown - and that is a new Science Centre. We have got the old Science Centre somewhere down here on the east of the lake and it has entertained and educated generations of Singaporeans almost 40 years, including many adults who are kids at heart. It is still popular but just like the gardens, it is great, but I think we need to do better. So, we will build a new Science Centre and we found the right spot down here - beautiful place on the north shore near the Chinese Garden MRT Station and we flew a drone over to show you the site. This is the Chinese Garden MRT Station, this is the Chinese Garden and this piece of land, this plot is the site. So, we have got the land, we have got a blank canvas to create something unique and we can do a completely new concept for the Science Centre to take full advantage of the site and the context. We can extend out the Centre into the gardens, integrate with the living environment, build something which is fun, educational and spectacular and celebrate the ethos of our society, reflect our curiosity about the world, our spirit of scientific inquiry, our quest, restlessness to innovate and to improve and I think we will inspire and educate our young people in fun and exciting ways. It will be the ‘Jewel’ in Jurong. By 2020 or thereabouts, we will have it done.
We can do this and so much more to keep Singapore special, but what matters most is not what we build but the power of our human spirit, showing determination and resolve like our pioneers, aiming high and pushing ahead, as our young should, contributing in big ways and small to Singapore, no matter what our station in life.
In my Chinese speech I talked about the 新谣song, 小人物的心声 - Voices from the Heart. I chanced across one vivid and moving example recently of an ordinary Singaporean who made a difference. Just before National Day, I received a email from Mr Mohamed Zulkifli, who I found out later is a senior journalist at Berita Harian and he told me that his father Mr Rahmat Yusak, had worked with Mr Lee Kuan Yew. In the early 1960s, Mr Lee had visited constituencies all over the island to rally the ground in the battle against the communists. We talked about it just now when we talked about the pioneer generation of the organising secretaries and Mr Lee went in an open top Land Rover and Mr Rahmat drove that Land Rover. You can see him here. So, Mr Zulkifli said that his father, aged 95, was very ill. In fact, Mr Rahmat passed away shortly afterwards and Mr Zulkifli wrote to me. He said, “My father was only a driver but I hope people like him will not be forgotten when Singapore honours its Pioneer Generation”.
Well, I remember Mr Rahmat because I used to follow my father on the visits and if you look carefully at this Land Rover, you will see there is a little finger down here and the face is hidden, but I think that is me. Mr Lee also remembered Mr Rahmat. He paid a tribute to Mr Rahmat on the 20th anniversary of the People’s Association and I quote what Mr Lee wrote then – ‘I cannot adequately express my abiding gratitude to all those officers who sacrificed so many weekends to accompany me on all the tours, including the cheerful driver, Rahmat Yusak. He drove that exposed Land Rover with full confidence, bringing me to all 51 constituencies. They were dedicated men. They slogged with me to help the Government win over the ground. Had the PAP lost in September 1963, the history of Singapore would have been different.’ For his services, Mr Rahmat received the Public Service Medal (Bronze) from President Yusof Ishak.
So, I say to Mr Zulkifli, we will never forget your father, Mr Rahmat Yusak nor the many pioneers who build Singapore, including Encik Yusof Ishak, our first President, who championed enduring values that helped us to succeed. Or Madam Wong Ah Woon, who toiled for 44 years to put up so many buildings all over the island. Or Dr Uma Rajan, who kept our schoolchildren healthy. They boldly wrote the opening chapters of the Singapore Story and paved the way for their children to do better and write the rest. Because of them, we have path-breakers like Liang Wern Fook (梁文福) and Yan Choong Lian (严众莲) – enriching our lives with song and dance. Skilled professionals like Roy Lim, Abu Bakar and Dorothy Han – seizing opportunities, pursuing passions and realising their potential.
Now, it is our turn to give the next generation full opportunities to chase their dreams, young adults like Divesh Singaraju and William Tay – never giving in to adversity. Ang Kian Hua (洪健华) and Iswandie Wanhar – upgrading themselves and becoming masters of their trade. Fauziah Ally and Afzal Ali – launching their careers and I am sure, in time, making a difference to the lives of others.
We have all contributed to the Singapore Story. At the heart of the Singapore Story is our belief in Singapore, belief that we can turn vulnerability and despair into confidence and hope; belief that out of the trauma of separation, we could build a modern metropolis and a beautiful home; belief that whatever the challenges of this uncertain world we can thrive and prosper as one united people. Let this belief and spirit burn bright in each one of us and guide us forward for the next 50 years and more. Together, let us be the pioneers of our generation. Together, let us create a brighter future for all Singaporeans.
Thank you and good night.

   singaporewebsite update april",12644,"In his National Day Rally speech on August 17, 2014, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted Singapore's progress and future plans, emphasizing the nation's commitment to honoring its pioneers and continuing its development trajectory. He announced the renaming of institutions and the introduction of initiatives in honor of Yusof Ishak, Singapore's first President, to commemorate the SG50 celebrations. PM Lee also detailed the Pioneer Generation Package focused on healthcare benefits, acknowledging the contributions of pioneers like Yusof Ishak in building modern Singapore.

Addressing the nation's future, PM Lee outlined significant infrastructural and social developments. He discussed the stabilization of the housing market, enhancements in public transport, and educational reforms to provide Singaporeans with full opportunities to achieve their potential. The speech also touched on the importance of self-reliance and community support in tackling future challenges, including those posed by international tensions and domestic social needs.

PM Lee introduced plans to transform the Jurong Lake District into a vibrant residential and recreational hub, with the relocation of the Ayer Rajah Expressway to facilitate this development. He proposed the construction of a new Science Centre in the area to inspire future generations in scientific inquiry and innovation.

The speech reaffirmed the government's commitment to supporting lower-income groups and the elderly through schemes like the Silver Support Scheme and enhancements to the CPF system to provide more flexibility and assurance for retirement.

Overall, PM Lee's speech underscored the government's vision of continuous improvement in infrastructure, education, and social policies to ensure that Singapore remains a resilient, inclusive, and forward-looking nation."

My fellow Singaporeans, good evening.
First, let us thank Kit Chan again for her beautiful singing and also for dedicating her song to Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I am very glad I invited her to the rally, and I am very touched that she offered to sing “Home”, which is a fitting tribute to Mr Lee and a good start for the SG50 National Day Rally. Two weeks ago, on the 9th of August, we celebrated our Golden Jubilee with a parade at the Padang. For everyone who took part at the Padang, at the Floating Platform, around the Bay, watching at home or overseas, that night was something special to remember. It was not just a birthday bash, we were celebrating something far greater.
First of all, we celebrated our resolve to defend ourselves and to survive over the last 50 years. We started out at independence with only two infantry battalions in a rough neighbourhood. But our pioneers were determined to defend ourselves - we built up the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Within four years, we paraded a few of our units on National Day in 1969.
Overhead, we had one Hunter aircraft and one Alouette helicopter flying the Singapore flag. In the mobile column, we had 18 AMX-13 tanks, which were appearing in public for the first time and Major Goh Lye Choon was a second in command. Singaporeans cheered, everyone understood what it meant and it was not just Singaporeans who took note. Fifty years later, our pioneer servicemen kicked off the SG50 vintage parade. Right marker, Colonel Swee Boon Chai - first batch, Officer Cadet School (OCS). Marching with him was Captain Hong Seng Mak, the legendary Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) - Tiger Hong. Ibrahim Bulat, who trained the first national servicemen. John Norfor and K S Rajan, our pioneer pilots. Chan Seck Sung, our first US Ranger-trained commando, still wearing a red beret. Encik Mohd Saleh, Warrant Officer Class 1 Navy pioneer who was one of the oldest participants, 77 years young. We had Corporal Philip Ng, a citizen soldier, NSF 4 SIR 1972, NS Man 61 SIR, ten years - 1974 to 1984 - now Mindef reserve, still marching. And many others too, older, greyer but the spirit remain undaunted and I am so glad that we have some of them here with us tonight. Thank you very much. Take a bow together.
Above us, instead of one Hunter fighter, we had 20 F-16s, flying across the Padang forming the Number “50”. A Chinook helicopter flew the flag, escorted by two Apaches and Colonel Goh Lye Choon, now retired, was once again the Second-in-Command (2-IC) of the mobile column, this time on a Leopard tank. That is him. Behind Lye Choon, 178 vehicles rolled past the City Hall steps. Tanks, artillery, AA missile launchers, special ops vehicles, Hazmat vehicles and completing the mobile column we had nine vehicles carrying nine families. They were the pioneers who had served in the SAF and the Home Team and they were on parade with their children who are presently serving and in two cases, with their grandchildren too. And here we have a family - grandfather, father and son. The son is Corporal (Cpl) Tajol Isfahan, 22 years old who joined the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) full-time three months ago. The father is Senior Warrant Office Mohd Azlan, who’s 48 years old, who is an SCDF Marine Command Specialist and their grandfather Mr Selamat, 78 years old. He joined the Singapore Fire Brigade in 1948 before I was born – I think before most of you were born. He was involved in many major fire and rescue incidents – the Bukit Ho Swee fire in 1961, the Robinson’s Department Store fire in 1972, Hotel New World in 1986. Three generations saluting the nation and we saluted them back.
Secondly, on National Day, we celebrated how we had turned vulnerability into strength. We started off with no hinterland and a weak economy. We depended on our entrepot trade, but our neighbours were building their own ports and sought to bypass us. Our workers were unskilled and anxious about their future but we determined to make the world our hinterland. And the tripartite partners worked together, worked hard to create the best workforce in the world. The Government, the employers and the Unions, we worked together, Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) every year ranked us number 1 in the world. And with that workforce, we made PSA and Changi, the best in the world.
We were a poor third world country; people lived in cramped and squalid slums, no modern sanitation, no utilities, but we built HDB flats to house all of us and made Singapore a first world metropolis and our beautiful home. Nearly all our water came from Johor and every now and again when an issue arose with Malaysia, some crazy politician would threaten to turn off the tap, to get us in line, but we did not die of thirst. We cleaned up our rivers, we dammed them up to become reservoirs, we built Marina Barrage and turned Marina Bay into Marina reservoir. Our whole island became a catchment area. We invented NEWater and on National Day 2002, we toasted our success. Huat Ah!
Thirdly, we celebrated our journey from third world to first as one united people. When we separated from Malaysia, we were not yet one people. Memories of the race riots were fresh and raw. The minorities were uncertain of their place in the new country. They saw what had happened in Malaysia. They wondered, will the new Singapore Government keep its promise of a multi-racial society. But 50 years on, we celebrate as one united people. On National Day, when the siren sounded, we stood and recited the Pledge together - regardless of race, language or religion. We sang Majulah Singapura.
What an exhilarating journey these 50 years have been. How did we get here? I will put it down to three factors. Firstly, we determined to be a multi-racial society. Secondly, we created a culture – a culture of self-reliance, and also mutual support. And thirdly, we kept faith between the Government and the people.

We believed that before race, language and religion, we should first and foremost be Singaporean.
PM Lee
First of all, multi-racialism. We separated from Malaysia because we believed in this ideal of a multi-racial society. We believed that before race, language and religion, we should first and foremost be Singaporean. That was the fundamental reason for our foundation as a country. So we came down hard on chauvinists and racial extremists. We built HDB estates where all the different races lived and mingled together. There are no segregated ghettos in Singapore. We made English our working language and gradually all our schools shifted to teaching in English. We created Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) so that minorities would always be represented in Parliament and this way, we encouraged all the communities to come together and yet gave each community space to maintain their own cultures and their own ways of life. When delicate and awkward issues arose, we dealt with them together.
For example, when we discovered the Jemaah Islamiyah group, planning to set off suicide bombs in Singapore after 9/11, we handled it as one people; we did not divide into Muslims and non-Muslims. At the same, we made the effort to bring everybody together and to ensure that every community could hold his own and not be left behind. So we set up self-help groups, the communities did, starting with the Council for the Development of Singapore Malay/Muslim Community (Mendaki), later the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), then Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) and the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP) and the Eurasian Association. The Government supported them and so we progressed together.
Therefore, for SG50, every community in Singapore is celebrating because every community has progressed with the nation. And each group is celebrating with the other groups because we are one united people. I have attended many SG50 celebrations this year – a Catholic Jubilee Mass at the Indoor Stadium; the SG50 Kita National Day Observance Ceremony here in this campus, led by the Malay/ Muslim organisations but with other groups participating; a Buddhist celebration at the Indoor Stadium; a Protestant prayer event at the National Stadium; a joint concert organised by the Taoist Federation; the New Creation Church and others at the Star Performing Arts Centre. Here you see, one of the items - a Chinese Kungfu group performing with the Silat group. One function. At one dinner, I had sitting around my table representatives of all the world’s major religions and I posted the picture on Facebook. It showed the Rabbi of Singapore together with the Mufti of Singapore and Mr Gurmit Singh, a Sikh leader who was then chairing the IRO, the Inter-Religious Organisation. Each had different dietary rules, each was served food that met his religious requirements, but nothing stopped them from having a meal together and being friends together, in fact, they took a selfie together, which I also posted on Facebook. Only in Singapore!
Some people may think that racial and religious harmony is not a problem anymore and that I am making too much about this. But they would be wrong. Race and religion are always sensitive matters, especially for us and in some ways, today, more complex and difficult to handle than 20 years ago, because religiosity has gone up. Many societies, people are taking their religion more seriously, happens in developed countries like US, Britain, Australia, Germany where you see racial and religious tensions. Happens in Singapore too, not tensions but people taking religion more seriously and everywhere people exposed and vulnerable to extremist ideologists, like the Jihadist ideology of ISIS. We are a multi-racial and multi-religious society and we are always at risk of deep fault lines opening up, and we must never take our present happy state of affairs for granted.
The second factor of our success, after multi-racialism, is our culture of self-reliance and mutual support. We knew right from the start that to strike out and blaze a path on our own, everyone had to pull their weight and be counted, we could not afford free-riders and that is why Mr Lee Kuan Yew exhorted us over and over again to become a rugged society. We do not use that term quite so often anymore, but our people must still be robust and tough, be able to take hard knocks, always striving to be better. No one owes us a living and we have to make our own way forward in the world. But a rugged society does not mean every man for himself. We are strong even though we are small, because we are strong together. The ethos of our society is clear – if you work hard, you should do well and that is good for you and we should cheer you and celebrate it, but at the same time if you do well, we expect you to help others and everyone has to work together so that we succeed as one team Singapore.
We have got to inculcate this ethos in our young people too. And that is why we encourage our children to play sports to experience losing and winning together. That is why we send them on adventure learning and character education. To OBS, Outward Bound Singapore in Pulau Ubin and also on overseas expeditions, so that they can toughen themselves up and learn to work with one another as a team. When I was in Secondary four, my principal sent me to OBS, the experience made a deep impression on me. Nowadays, students have many more opportunities to go for adventure learning, here and also abroad. Tanjong Katong Primary School (TKPS) had a very successful programme, the Omega Challenge. It has been going on for seven years, the students who have been, have testified to how much they benefitted from it. Tragically on their recent expedition to climb Mount Kinabalu, the Omega Challenge group was caught in an earthquake. Seven students, two teachers and a guide died. We all mourned them and grieved with their families, we held a National Day of Remembrance. It will take us a long time to get over this tragedy but life goes on and it is important that we move on. And I know that the other TKPS students and teachers who were on this trip are courageously doing so. We have to go on with the adventure training, we will take the necessary safety precautions but we must keep pushing our limits to bring up a generation who will grow up tough and able to work closely together.
The third factor for our success is that we have kept faith between the Government and the people. We have built up this bond between the Government and the people over the past 50 years. The Government has kept its promises, what we said we would do, we did do. We have kept our politics honest, we insisted on high standards of integrity in public life, no corruption, no dishonesty. We are also honest when it comes to policies and when it comes to the choices that we have to make. We do not shy away from hard realities, we do not sugar-coat difficult issues. We do right by Singaporeans. In turn, our people expect the Government to perform, trust the Government to have their interests at heart and support the Government and its decisions to work for the common good. And even in tough times, we can act decisively together.
It was like this with our Pioneer Generation, for example on the issue of Land Acquisition. The Government needed land to build HDB new towns around the island to house our people. To build industrial estates like Jurong to create jobs for our people. Later on to build the MRT network to move people around. So the Government passed laws to acquire land not at the market price, without paying market prices. It was tough for the land owners who suffered financial losses, sometimes more than once. It was tough for the households who had to be resettled, lives were disrupted, thousands, maybe tens of thousands had to change their livelihoods. But if the Government had not done this, we could not have housed our population and we could not have transformed Singapore, so there were sacrifices but in the end, it was for the common good and everybody benefitted and I thank all those who sacrificed for this common good.
Even with recent times, we had to do tough things together. During SARS in 2003, we passed laws urgently on the certificate of urgency to quarantine people at home, to prevent community spread and we will ring you up and ask you to turn up on your camera to show that you are still there. Singaporeans understood this was necessary and they accepted it. Recently, South Korea had a serious outbreak of MERS but they had problems quarantining people. It was not so easy for them to get people to cooperate. There was one case, where a person was missing from her home, they knocked on the door, no answer, telephone no answer, tracked her down via her hand phone. She was several hundred kilometers away, playing golf. You can pass the laws but people have to cooperate.
From time to time, new tough issues will come up and we will need your support to deal with them. One tough issue which we already have and which will be with us for a long time to come is immigration and foreigners. It is a very sensitive matter, not an easy thing to talk about, even at the National Day Rally and Singaporeans understandably have strong views about it. The Government has heard them, we have adjusted our policies, upgraded our infrastructure, slowed down the inflow of foreign workers, tightened up on PR and citizenships applications, made sure that Singaporeans are fairly treated at work. But on foreigners and immigration, there are no easy choices. Every option has a cost, has a downside. If we close our doors to foreign workers, our economy will tank. Companies would not have enough workers. Some will close down and our own people working in these companies will lose their jobs. Also we need foreign workers to build our homes and schools, to meet our daily needs, we need foreign domestic help. So we cannot close our doors completely. On the other hand, if we let in too many foreign workers, our society will come undone. Singaporeans will be crowded out, workplaces will feel foreign, our identity will be diluted and we just cannot digest huge numbers. Therefore, we have got to find something in-between, make a right trade-off but even in-between there is a cost and there is a price and there is a pain. Companies will still find your costs going up, they will have to pass some of these costs on to consumers. Things would not be as cheap. Companies will have to pass up opportunities too. When they can see the opportunities but cannot get the workers, many companies will not be able to expand. And yet because some foreign workers will still be coming in, there will be Singaporeans who will feel that Singapore is changing too fast and will resent having to compete with non-Singaporeans. Whichever option we choose, it will involve some pain.
But I believe that I am doing what Singapore needs and what best safeguards your interest. If I did not believe that, I would not be doing it. It is my responsibility to make this decision, to make this judgement and then to act on your behalf. And having acted on your behalf, to account to you for the results and for the reasons why I decided the way I did. I think I owe it to you. You have elected me. This is my duty, I cannot shirk it.

These principles have brought us here – multiracialism, self-reliance and mutual support, keeping faith between the government and people. These principles have made us special. They are not so easy to do. Easy to say, not so easy to do. Very few countries have got this right but by and large, we have got it right. And Singapore has to stay special because if we are just a dull little spot on the map, a smudge, we are going to count for nothing. We have to be a shining red dot. If we are soft and flabby, we are going to be eaten up. We have to be rugged and we have to have that steel in us. If we are divided, whether along racial lines or class lines, we cannot survive. We have to stand as one united people, we have to progress together.

We have to be a shining red dot.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
How do we stay special? First, we have to be alive to our external environment. That is a fundamental reality for a “little red dot”. We will always be a small country in Southeast Asia. This is an exciting place to be, but also a rather dangerous place to live. I have not spoken much about the external affairs in recent rallies because we have been focused on domestic issues. But I think I have spoken too little because big things are happening around us and they are bound to affect us and unless we keep track of events and stay on top of developments, we may be overwhelmed. We have good relations with our neighbours, much better than 50 years ago and our neighbours have done well and we have prospered with them. But it may not always be like this. Even in the next 10 years, we cannot be sure. Certainly, in the next 50 years, nobody can rule out instability, tension, or even war in Asia.
Take Malaysia, our closest neighbour, our very close partner. We watch what is happening in Malaysia very closely. What are the Malaysians worried about? I can tell you what they are worried about. They worry about ISIS and terrorism because Malaysian citizens are becoming radicalised, going to Syria and Iraq to fight, including members of their armed forces going to become terrorists. Some have already gone, dozens are there. When they come back, they will bring back violence, the know-how and the extremist ideas. This year alone, Malaysian authorities have arrested nearly 100 citizens suspected of links with ISIS. That is one thing they worry about which we should worry about. They worry about racial and religious tensions, about society being divided along racial lines. They have had incidents recently like the riot in Low Yat Plaza, between Chinese and Malays, which have prompted soul searching. If they have racial problems, it will affect us across the border. They worry about money politics. 1MDB is in the news every day and Prime Minister Najib has just set up a national panel to develop laws on “political funding with integrity” because everybody knows this is the problem. These are Malaysia’s problems. Fortunately we are a different country, having separated from Malaysia 50 years ago. But our two societies and our two economies remain very closely intertwined. So their problems can easily become our problems. And if Malaysia is troubled, unstable or divided, it will affect our economy, our society and our security too. And the closer we work with them, the more we are concerned that things go well for them.
Indonesia is also important to us. It is the biggest country in Southeast Asia, it sets the tone for the whole region. When Indonesia is stable, all its neighbours benefit. If Indonesia is in a state of flux, Southeast Asia will be affected, as it was during confrontation. We have enjoyed good relations with Indonesia for many years. With President Suharto since 1970s, then with President SBY (Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono) over the last decade and now I look forward to continuing these good relations with President Jokowi. But Indonesia is a big and complex country and there are different views within Indonesia about its neighbours. And one common Indonesian view about Singapore is that we are a small neighbour enjoying undeserved success at their expense. I told you in my Chinese speech just now of one Indonesian official who explained this mindset to us but I give you another example here.
On our National Day, just recently on the 9th of August, one Indonesian newspaper published an overview of the relationship between them and us. And they quoted a senior Indonesian politician what he said about the haze. He said, “I would only consider apologising for the haze if Singapore and Malaysia are thankful for the oxygen from Indonesian forests for 11 months each year”. So you know where you stand and please know your place in the world. Do not get uppity. This may not reflect the Indonesian Government’s view, but we have to take note of it. It is a deep seated mindset – that a little red dot red dot should know its place in the world – and this mindset will not disappear for a long time. I once met a group of Indonesian journalists. We invite them to our National Day to understand us and to write about us. So they asked me, the usual questions which Indonesian journalists ask us about – smuggling, about money laundering, about sand, about us taking advantage and so on, I gave them explanations. At the end of it all, they were persuaded, then they said to me, “Do you feel discouraged that you keep on explaining and at the end we keep writing the same thing?” I said no, I am not discouraged at all, I am quite used to it. But I think that’s the fundamental reality and it is not going to change for very long time to come.
We also have to watch relations between the major powers in the region. We are friends with all the major powers, with America, with China, with Japan – all three. And people are amazed that we can be friends with all three and they ask how this is possible? Well, we tell them just good luck but partly, it’s also because of adroit diplomacy, because we have good officers in the MFA. But we have been lucky, we have been lucky that the big powers have been at peace with one another. And so we don’t have to choose sides, with one against the other.
But will it be so easy to maintain this happy state of affairs in future? Will the stars always be so neatly aligned? What if relations among the powers sour and hot up? There could be a miscalculation, there could be a mishap. There could be a misunderstanding. If American and Chinese airplanes collide over the South China Sea, or Japanese and Chinese ships clash near the Diaoyu Dao or the Senkaku Islands. Then tensions will go up, countries will press us to take sides. You are either with us, or against us. Which are you? We have to decide which are we. It’s not so easy to decide and these are imponderables and risks which we have to be aware of and which Mr Lee Kuan Yew was very concerned that Singaporeans may not be adequately aware of and wanted to speak about, even into his extreme old age. It was that important to him. It is in fact that important to us.
We have been able to maintain our security, and our standing in the world because we have a strong SAF so others do not fool around with us. Because our economy is successful, so others find it worthwhile to cooperate with us. Because we have good diplomats and good leaders, who talk sense, command respect and can defend our interests abroad. These are important advantages for a small country which does not have aircraft carriers to go sailing around, keeping the peace and keeping ourselves safe. And we must keep these advantages to sail through the next 50 years safely. Let me just give you two examples of how having good ministers can advance our interests abroad, out of many.
Take Minister Vivian – Vivian Balakrishnan. Minister for Environment, Water Resources. Last year, he attended the UN Climate Change Conference which was held in Peru, in Lima in December. Vivian led the Singapore delegation but he did not just represent Singapore. He was appointed one of two Friends of the Chair. The other Friend of the Chair was Norway. And the role of the Friend of the Chair is to be an honest broker. To work behind the scenes to bridge the gaps between the different countries, to help put together a deal that countries could agree upon. So it is an important low-key job. They chose Vivian and Vivian was effective. Why? Because he was competent and mastered a very complicated brief. Every time he briefs Cabinet, we have to spend time reading the paper understanding the subject all over again and asking Vivian what does all these mean? But it his job to know and to explain and to analyse how we can protect our interests and not be disadvantaged. But he also was supported by a strong and cohesive team of Singapore officials. Different ministries, each knowing their job but able to work together across the ministries and take a national perspective. So they could staff him, they could work out alternatives, they could propose compromises, they could tweak the language, they can go and chat up different groups and find out what different groups are thinking. That was Team Singapore at work. They actually should wear red T-shirts at such meetings. Vivian and Team Singapore helped the Lima conference to reach a successful outcome. They had to overrun. I think they went for another 36 hours but in the end there was a positive agreement and in the process, the agreement also protected and advanced Singapore’s interests. That’s one example.I give you another example. These are all far away from defence. So people understand that even apart from armed forces, we have to be on our guard and know how to work with others to advance our interest. This next example is Lim Swee Say. Swee Say attends the ILO Conference in Geneva every year. International Labour Organisation. He used to go as Secretary General of NTUC, now he goes as Minister for Manpower. This year he went in June, the Director-General of ILO hosted the conference dinner, so dinner is meant to talk shop. And at dinner many of the Labour Ministers shared the problems they faced in their countries, all facing similar problems – slow job, growth youth unemployment, stagnating wages, widening income gaps. It was a very miserable dinner. So Swee Say is never one for a miserable dinner, he decided to turn the discussion around and to focus on solutions and not problems and he did it, the way only Swee Say knows how to do it. He started by acknowledging we all face the same 3 “D” challenges, D for delta. What’s D? Jobs Deficit, Skills Deficit, Quality Deficit, so three D’s. So everybody nodded, say yes. Then he said, we all want the same three F’s opportunities – future. Jobs of the future, skills of the future, career of the future, everybody smiled. Then he concluded that the solution was to strengthen the three P’s – Partnership between the partners. Partners: Government, unions and employers. And he shared about Singapore’s unique tripartite approach and sold a little bit of “koyok” for us. So when Swee Say had finished, the mood in the room had lifted and everyone was discussing solutions and not moping. And the Director-General rounded the discussion and proposed three cheers for Singapore.
We must maintain this quality of leaders and strengthen our economy and our defence in order to hold our own with the outside world, to work with others to advance our interests and to protect ourselves when the external environment becomes troubled or hostile.

We have to stand as one united people, we have to progress together.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
The next thing we must do to continue being special, is to keep on improving our education, not just in schools, but also life-long learning because education enables our people to be self-reliant, because our workers and students must stay ahead of globalisation and technology. Last year, I explained SkillsFuture, which provides Singaporeans with opportunities to develop to their full potential, whatever their starting point may be.
Since then, we have made some progress, for example, we have a SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme, it gives fresh ITE and Polytechnic graduates a head-start in their careers. They can earn a full-time salary, at the same time learn new skills and then upgrade to higher jobs. We have created the SkillsFuture Credit so every Singaporean aged 25 and above will have initially $500 of credit in the account to spend on training programmes throughout life and from time to time, we will top up that credit. Tonight, I will tell you about another thing we are doing, which has to do with SIT – the Singapore Institute of Technology. SIT provides applied-learning pathways for students who prefer more hands-on learning. SIT awards its own degrees; it also awards degrees in collaboration with respected overseas partners. For example, TUM – Technical University of Munich or CIA, Culinary Institute of America, it teaches you to cook, not to spy. Or DigiPen Institute of Technology, one of the top institutions for animation, computer engineering and game design. SIT is expanding its intake so it can take in more poly students, more mature students. This year, 2,000 students already, when five years’ time by 2020, 3,500 students.
I visited SIT a few months ago at their campus at Dover Road. I met their students and staff, they were keen about their future, passionate about what they were doing and the students relished the opportunities for internships to apply what they have learnt and to show off their skills. And one such student is Chen Zhangkai, who is 27. Zhangkai is a late bloomer; when he was young, he played truant, he got into fights, he was streamed into EM3, almost failed his PSLE. So he took a longer path than usual. From PSLE he went to Normal Technical (stream), then to ITE, then to Nanyang Polytechnic, then to SIT. Step by step, persevering, overcoming setbacks, climbing up. Last year, Zhangkai graduated from SIT with a Digipen degree. His final year project and portfolio were good, and a director of an animation studio came, saw it, was impressed, offered him an internship and after that offered him a job. So Zhangkai has now landed himself a dream job as an animator. Well done Zhangkai. SkillsFuture will produce more success stories like Zhangkai. There are always opportunities no matter where you are to upgrade and do better.
SIT’s main campus is at Dover Road with branch campuses in all the polytechnics. So we will bring all these branch campuses together and build one new centralised campus for SIT. And the new campus will be in Punggol. Across the road from SIT, we will build a creative industry cluster, in fact, on both sides of SIT. JTC will do this and bring creative industries to come to be next to SIT and to be integrated with SIT. So that students can easily go from classroom to workplace, apply what they learn. Companies can easily go to SIT and get help if they need some new ideas or some problem solved. SIT will also be integrated into Punggol Downtown, an HDB upcoming Northshore District. And the community will share SIT’s facilities; the classrooms, the workshops, the multi-purpose hall. So, we have talked about Punggol 21, we have Punggol 21 Plus with SIT, it will be Punggol 21 A-Plus. Here is how the SIT campus will look like. SIT in the middle and you can see the industry buildings on both sides, if you zoom in and take a closer look, you can see the University on one side, the industries on the other and linked bridges joining them up, so people can go back and forth. This will come.
It is a long-term effort and the Chinese saying, says: “十年树木，百年树人” – ten years to grow a tree, one hundred years to nurture a person. When we go into SkillsFuture, this is our mindset. We are planting for the long term; planting seeds now to bear fruit many years from now. Of course, we also will be planting real trees on the SIT campus and when they are grown, many years now, I hope the campus will look something like this, and Punggol 21 residents will be happy.
While SkillsFuture creates more opportunities for Singaporeans, we will continue to make sure that no one is left behind. There is an African saying which says: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” For the last 50 years, we have gone together and we have gone far. That is what we must do for the next 50 years.
HDB housing is one important way we make sure that we go together. We started the HDB home ownership programme in the 1960s and it has been a tremendous success. Today, more than 90 per cent of HDB households own their flats. We are a nation of home-owners and we have achieved something unique for our people, home ownership and no ghettos or slums anywhere in Singapore. There is a true story about an IMF economist who visited Singapore, Indian economist, his name is Sudip. And he stayed at the Fairmont. Fairmont Hotel, high up, looked out saw the beautiful city, he said, “Can’t be. I want to find out how big this nice area around the hotel is”. So he decided he would get down, walked in one direction until he reached a not-so-nice area, turned round come back then he will know Singapore is like so many other cities in the world, with rough areas. So Sudip came down, walked and walked and walked and walked, he never reached a rough area. After two hours, he gave up and came back, astonished and impressed that Singapore had no rough area. In Boston, I did the same experiment from Harvard, half an hour, I got there. And it is not unique; every city is like that except Singapore. In Singapore, no matter where you are, you live in a good neighbourhood, you have good homes, you have parks, you have waterways, you can feel safe and secure, you can go jogging in the middle of the night, even if you are a young lady; safe. This must always be the reality for all Singaporeans.
HDB flats will always be affordable and accessible to all. In the last five years, we have made big moves in housing. We have stabilised BTO prices, we have launched 100,000 HDB flats equal to four Clementi towns. We have shortened queues for flats so most firsttimers can now choose their flat in a non-mature estate on their first try. Some of them said, “Please don’t give me the flats so fast, I’m not ready to collect my keys yet.” But we are going to do three more things in housing.First, for the higher end households, we will make more Singaporeans eligible to buy HDB flats and ECs (Executive Condominiums). Currently, there is an income ceiling for HDB flats and ECs. HDB flats – ceiling $10,000; ECs – ceiling $12,000. We last raised this four years ago. Since then, incomes have gone up further and also since then we have cleared the first-timer backlog, queuing up for HDB flats. So, we have the possibility now to raise the income ceiling and bring more people into the eligibility net. What shall we do? For HDB flats, we will go from $10,000 to $12,000. For ECs, we will go from $12,000 to $14,000. This way, more households can buy HDB flats and ECs.
Secondly, we will help middle and lower-income households who are buying their first home, first timers. We will make HDB flats more affordable for them. We have a complicated system of HDB grants. If you are buying a house, you know the details but the gist of it is, there are weighted towards those who earn less. So the less you earn, the more generous our grants. The more you earn, you may still be eligible for an HDB flat but I think you can pay for a bit more of it yourself. So we will enhance our grants which help the lower and middle-income households buy flats. The way we do that is we have the Special CPF Housing Grant which is called the SHG – Special CPF Housing Grant. We will extend the SHG to cover more households. Right now, the SHG has an income ceiling, which is $6,500, and that is half of all households. And we will raise this ceiling to $8,500 so that two thirds of households will qualify for the SHG. We will also increase the amount of the SHG, because currently the maximum amount is $20,000 and we will double that to $40,000. So what does this mean? For a median household, one just about middle-income, buying a flat previously they would have received $10,000 of SHG, now they will receive $30,000 of SHG – three times as much.
The third thing we will do is, to help those in rental flats, to help them to own their flat. With the home ownership programme, almost all Singaporeans have been able to buy their homes but there are few who still cannot afford to do that or have not been able to hold onto their flats. So, for those who have not bought the flat ever before, Minister Khaw Boon Wan recently restructured the two-room flat and the Studio apartment schemes and after the restructuring, I think that will help, it is more flexible, it will be easier for people to buy their first flat, a two-room flat. Also now that we are doubling the maximum SHG, which I just told you about, that will make two-room flats even more affordable. How much more affordable? Last time when I was an HDB agent, I told you that if you earn $1,000 a month, you can buy a two-room flat. Now with these latest changes, even if you earn below $1,000 but you are holding a stable job and you contribute to CPF regularly, you can still afford to have a two-room flat. Come to your housing agent at your MPS (Meet-the-People Session) and we will work out the details.
There is another group of rental tenants who are more difficult to help, more tricky to help and these are ones who have bought a flat before, but sold it and are now back in a rental unit. They have already benefitted from previous HDB subsidies. So the Government cannot just give them another grant to buy another flat; otherwise there’s no end and it would not be fair to others. So these households find it particularly difficult to afford another flat. Also these households often have many different problems – jobs, relationships, children’s education, sometimes drugs and their housing problem is a result of their other problems. It’s not a house being an issue but because their lives are not in order, so the house is a consequence of the mess.
I am very concerned about the future of this group because without help, they may be permanently out of reach of getting a flat of their own. And they will be trapped in poverty and their children will be affected, and you perpetuate the cycle into the next generation.
So we have studied this problem at length. I think there is a way we can help these families to start afresh and to own their homes again. And we have got a scheme to do this which we’ll call it the Fresh Start Housing Scheme. What will a Fresh Start Housing Scheme do? It will help second-timer rental households own a two-room flat. The flat will have a shorter lease, the flat will have stricter resale conditions that can make it more affordable and also may maximise the chances of people holding on to it and not just flipping it. But it’s not just providing a flat. It’s also supporting the family with counsellors, to guide them to solve their problems holistically, all aspects – jobs, school, drugs, family relationships, planning for the future, saving for the future. The family has to play its part, and show that they are putting their lives in order, determined to get back on their feet, committed to putting their children through school. Then if they show that and with all these extra arrangements, I think we can justify providing a grant for them – a Fresh Start Housing Grant – to help them pay their flat. So it is not without conditions. You have to do your part. But you do your part, we help you, you have a second chance. And over time, with guidance, with help, through this Scheme you can own your own homes again. You have something to work towards, aspire to and achieve, for yourself, for your children. It’s a major initiative, it will take us sometime to work out but I think it is important because it shows our philosophy – that in Singapore, we will help you but you must help yourself and we do not want anybody to be left behind.
Finally, we have to manage our population issues well. Because whether our population is young or old, growing or shrinking, that determines how our society, our outlook, our confidence will be. I will speak about two groups tonight - the seniors, and families and babies. Let me start with the seniors. The elderly will always have a place in Singapore. We honour them because they brought us here, they brought us up, and they will always have something to contribute to Singapore. That is why we made the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) to express our gratitude to the pioneers who contributed so much to building today’s Singapore. Having made the package, we made an extra effort: we sent PG Ambassadors to every home, to visit pioneers at home, chat with them, understand their needs and explain to them how they can personally benefit from the PGP. And in the process of talking to them, we learnt many heart-warming stories and we collected them in a nice book which we launched last month. It’s titled, “Their Past: A Present for Our Future”. Quite a clever title; lots of interesting stories in the book. One in particular is about two friends - Mr Mutu Sammy, and Mr Ching Chong Kwi. Mr Mutu Sammy is 69 years old, Mr Ching is 81 years old. They have been neighbours and close friends for ten years. Mutu lost his leg long ago in a traffic accident. Mr Ching, who is 81 years old, takes care of Mutu - looks after his plants, changes light bulbs for him, drives him to medical check-ups. Mr Ching speaks Mandarin, Mutu speaks English, and they talk to each other in Malay. That’s the Kampong spirit for you. Mutu and Mr Ching told our Ambassadors that they are very happy with the PG Package and the PG Card because Mutu benefits directly from it. There is a PG Disability Assistance Scheme and he qualifies and he gets $100 a month, and when he visits the Specialist Outpatient Clinic, the net amount he has to pay is just $12. And of course both are happy to be honoured and to be recognised. We are grateful to all our Pioneers and I think at SG50 NDR, we should say again, thank you, pioneers of Singapore.
The senior citizens, I know what you are thinking, who are not quite as old as the PG, you are also very much in our minds. So when we did the PG Package, we also did a special package of Medisave top-ups for those who are slightly younger, did not quite qualify, like me. But I think what many seniors really want is not a package but to age well. Gan Kim Yong leads the Ministerial Committee on Ageing. He will announce an Action Plan soon, which we hope will make Singapore a model for successful ageing, handling this problem.
Let me give you just one sneak peek from his plan tonight. Many people who are in their 60s want to work longer. They say, “If I sit at home and do nothing, I will go ga-ga. Furthermore, my wife will tell me to go and do something about it."" So we raised the re-employment age to 65 three years ago. And the unions and workers were very happy. I think the employers have accepted it. They are adjusting to it and starting to benefit from it. It’s still too early to judge but so far, it seems to be working well.
From the workers’ point of view, 65 may be too early to stop work. Workers want us to raise the re-employment age and they want to keep working for as long as they are healthy. I hear this every time I attend a union function. I reply, “Yes, I agree fully. We will do it, we have choose a right time to do it because we want to make sure that the employers have the practical arrangements, and you can make a contribution at your company and it will not be a burden to the company.” Otherwise it’s not sustainable. But we have been working at this problem. The tripartite partners have been discussing this and I am happy to tell you that they have reached an agreement. And the agreement is that we will pass legislation to raise the re-employment age from 65 to 67. We will do it by 2017, in other words, after the coming election.
Now, let me talk about families and babies. We discuss these as policies - what should we do, rules, incentives - but at the root of this is not policy. It is people, families and their children. Our families are what make life meaningful for many of us and our children are what will ensure that Singapore will have a future. In fact, our children are the reason why we want Singapore to have a future, for them, and so we decided on a baby Jubilee Gift for SG50 babies. And you can see some of the things down here – A box, the strap, some T-shirts, and some other diaper holders. I am glad to hear from Grace Fu that we have given out almost 20,000 SG50 packets this year, including one to Tin Pei Ling. When I go around and see parents with the red sling, I will ask them “Ah, SG50 baby. Congratulations! How many months old?” And then, “When is the next one coming?” In fact, I have been trying to find a family which has two Jubilee babies. It is possible. And finally I came across one. Introducing Charlotte on the left and Colette, on the right, twins born three weeks ago. I hope couples continue to have many babies after SG50, but I know it is a serious decision. It is hard work and a lifelong commitment. You sacrifice your time, your sleep, you have to buy milk powder, diapers, and parenting goes on for many years, well after your children have supposedly grown up. Having a child is a major responsibility, but we will help you, because every Singapore child is precious to us because each one is a member of our Singapore family. So when I speak about families at the National Day Rally, I always try to do something to make it easier for parents to have babies. Not just practical help, but also signals to change mindsets and attitudes and, therefore, encourage people gradually to change behaviour. For example, making workplaces more family friendly or getting fathers to do their share of parental duties. If you look at the numbers, last year’s numbers seem promising. This is the graph of the babies born every year since 2000. 2000 was a bumper year. 41,600 Dragon Year. The next Dragon Year there is a bit of a blip, but what encourages me is that this year 2014, not a Dragon Year, but almost as big as a dragon. If you look back, it is almost 10 years since we have had that many babies in one year. So it is not bad and I expect that this year, we will have about the same number as 2014. On National Day this year, we had a record number of babies born – 129, 9th August babies.These are statistics, but what I see directly when I go around confirms this. Because nowadays I often see families who have lots of kids and they are proud and happy that they have many children and they tell me that they have many children. On the Jubilee weekend, I met the Goh family at new Ci Yuan Hawker Centre. I went to see the hawker food, but I got a bonus I saw some babies as well. I started off noticing this SG50 baby, then I counted the sister one, brother one, another brother one two, three, four, five kids in one Goh family. Father was not there. I said where’s the father? Father queuing up for food. So talked to the father, he works in the SAF, mother is a homemaker and they are enjoying family life. It is good! So I think this is a good time to give our families and babies efforts an extra push. We will push in four ways.
First, we will help couples who live closer to their parents. In the old days, we used to have extended families and everybody would be under one roof. It can be complicated, but it is also a strength. Now, people live in nuclear families. But many couples still want to stay with their parents or near their parents, or parents often would want to stay with or near their married children so that the grandparents can enjoy their grandkids and the adult children can help to look after the old folks as they age. HDB already has various schemes to support this, we have relooked at the HDB incentives and we will repackage them and re-launch them more generously. And we will introduce what we call Proximity Housing Grant. What is the Proximity Housing Grant? It is for every Singaporean household whether first timer or not, you will be eligible and you can get it when you buy a resale flat with your parents or near your parents or you buy a resale flat with your married children or near your married children, you can get the Proximity Housing Grant once. But MND will work out the details and we will announce them soon.
Secondly, we will enhance the Baby Bonus. We will increase the amount of the Bonus to help cover a little bit more of the child-raising costs during the child’s infancy and I think that will help because I hear mothers telling me that, milk powder is expensive. Well, that is so, this will be a little bit of assistance. Also, the Baby Bonus is presently just for the first four children, so we will now give it to every child. This will provide support to parents, more support to parents with larger families and also reflects our attitude that every child is valued in Singapore.
Thirdly, Medisave. In Singapore, when a new baby is born, you do not just get the birth certificate, you also get the CPF Medisave account. And the account comes with some money from the Government to help cover your MediShield premiums and vaccinations and other expenses, at least for the first few years. And this is called the Medisave grant for newborns. So we will increase the Medisave grant for newborns, we will make it enough to cover MediShield Life premiums until you are 21 years old and also help with other healthcare expenses such as recommended vaccinations. Because until 21, really the burden is on your parents. After 21, we presume you will be looking after yourself and this will give your parents greater peace of mind.
Fourthly, paternity leave. Fathers play a very important role in bringing up children. You have to do your part, if it is just the mother’s responsibility to care for and raise your children, I think the mother will decide enough is enough. Right now, fathers get one week of paternity leave, I think fathers can do more, so we will add one more week of paternity leave, making two weeks, do not go and play golf, please use it to take care of your kid. The Government will pay for this one extra week. We will implement this, but the companies have to agree to give the leave, so we will not force the companies for a start, we will implement this on a voluntary basis to give the companies, to give employers time to adjust and then after a few years, we will look at the position again. Of course, the public service, the civil service, will volunteer straightaway. So to all the public officers who may be watching tonight, you have no excuse. The Baby Bonus, the Medisave grant and the Paternity leave changes will apply with effect from the 1st of January, the 1st of January 2015 because this is a Jubilee year, I think we should give all the Jubilee’s babies this little Hong Bao. Grace Fu will tell you lots of details soon and I hope they will all be happy details and they will help many more couples to experience the joys of parenthood.

For Singapore to continue to do well, we must have that resolve to defend this land.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
For Singapore to continue to do well, we must have that resolve to defend this land. We must have that will to make Singapore endure and to prevail and we must stand as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion. After 50 years, this faith, this sense of togetherness and purpose is stronger than before. The Singapore spirit ignites when we celebrate our successes together. When our athletes made us proud at the SEA Games, like Shanti Pereira who won our first sprint gold in 42 years or Ashley Liew, the marathon runner. After the other runners took a wrong turn, he slowed down and waited for them to catch up and showed sportsmanship and class. The Singapore spirit shines when we help one another in times of need. When we were beset by severe haze in 2013, many people came forward to distribute masks and help the less abled. When a man was run over by a truck recently, people rushed forward to push the truck, lift it up and help the man out. After a bomb exploded in Bangkok last week, Singaporeans living in Bangkok contacted the embassy to offer help.
Our spirit shone brightest when Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away. Hundreds of thousands lined up, day and night to pay their respects at Parliament House and at many community tribute sites. Mr Lee’s passing brought out so much in us. People queued patiently, they let children and seniors through, businesses provided free chairs and refreshments to those queuing up, volunteers helped out, distributing umbrellas, food, drinks and when the gun carriage carried Mr Lee on his final journey from Parliament House to the UCC, the University Cultural Centre, tens of thousands lined the streets and then it started to rain, what do we do? Everyone stayed put, it was like the 1968 National Day Parade when it poured on the parade after it had formed up. The funeral procession started on time into the pouring rain. I was deeply moved to see the crowds, stand their ground paying their last respects to Mr Lee, tear drops and raindrops fell together. For all of us, this was a historic moment shared as one Singapore family. We were mourning Mr Lee’s passing but also affirming what he stood for and celebrating what he had achieved. That day, something changed in us. Our shared moment of sorrow bonded us. Now we do not have to struggle to find words to define the Singapore spirit or to say what being Singaporean is. Now we know that we are Singaporean.
50 years ago, our challenges seemed insurmountable. As a small country, we could easily have flickered and faded into the darkness of history. But our pioneers were made of stern stuff, they were galvanised. Many born elsewhere but deciding to make Singapore their home and their lifelong passion. They dug in their heels and built a nation together. 50 years on, our challenges are still formidable but they are far from insurmountable. Those people who feel daunted and think Singapore’s best days are behind us, they are wrong. Our best days will always be ahead of us, provided we continue to have a strong team, a team of lions and the lion-hearted, leaders and the people. We have had such a good team so far, started with Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his colleagues, together with the pioneer generation, who built Singapore and made sure that Singapore would thrive beyond them. They handed over to Mr Goh Chok Tong and the second generation of Singaporeans 25 years ago now.
Our generation inherited Singapore from them and together, we took Singapore further forward to reach SG50. In the last ten years, we have written perhaps, another chapter of the Singapore story. If you have been following my National Day Rallies, you will know what we have done together.
We said we would build more beautiful homes that Singaporeans could afford, and we did. This is Punggol 21. This is the view from Dawson, I think it is taken from the air terrace, I went up to take a look, the city rejuvenated. We have continued the Kampong spirit. During Ramadan, neighbours break fast together along HDB corridors. All over the island, volunteers have beautified our shared spaces with Communities in Bloom.
We said we would strengthen our safety nets, and we did. We introduced Workfare, Silver Support, ComCare, we built new hospitals, Ng Teng Fong Hospital has opened since my last rally. Community hospitals have also opened, this is Renci and Yishun Community Hospital will soon be ready. We have made healthcare more accessible and affordable. We have CHAS, the blue card and the orange card. And we have the PG card. With MediShield Life, Singaporeans have lifelong healthcare coverage. We helped each other too, going door-to-door delivering milk powder and food to needy families. Seniors have kept active, exercising to stay fit and healthy as they age. And if you think these exercises are not quite challenging enough, you can try to do these exercises.
We said we would create more pathways for children to chase rainbows, and we did. We built Northlight and Assumption Pathway for students who failed their PSLE, because we believe in our young and we will never give up on them. We built the School of the Arts, the Sports School, the School of Science and Technology to cater to varied talents. We built first class campuses for our ITE Colleges, including ITE College Central, where we are now. We built new universities, Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), UniSIM. If they were not first class institutions, Chen Long (Jackie Chan) would not have given us these beautiful old Chinese buildings to be part of SUTD. But, we are special and we will keep it so.
We said that we would transform our city, and we did. Changi Airport is upgrading, project Jewel, T4 and T5 are coming up. The Gardens by the Bay are an iconic and popular attraction. We have beautiful park connectors and ABC waterways, like Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. I took Prime Minister Tony Abbott there, the Australian PM, to show him how Singaporeans live and the natural environment that we all enjoy. I think it is worth showing off Bishan- Ang Mo Kio Park. Our volunteers have been active too, preserving nature and heritage on Pulau Ubin, keeping our rivers clean.
We said we would transform Marina Bay, and we did. This was Marina Bay in 2005 with Marina South still empty land and at my rally that year, I promised you that by our Jubilee year, Marina Bay would be special and this is Marina Bay today. We did this together. We had a vision, we believed in it, and together, we realised our dreams.
In the last ten years, we built on what we inherited. We put brick on brick, we climbed step by step, we kept Singapore special, delivered results for Singaporeans. How did we do that? Mr Lee and his team planned beyond their terms, beyond their lifetimes. They nurtured the next generation of leaders and the next generation of Singaporeans. They taught their successors to do the same and this is what my team and I have sought to do for the last ten years. We have served you to the best of our ability, you have got to know us well, we have walked this SG50 journey together with you. My team and I take very seriously our responsibility to make sure that Singapore lasts beyond us. My core team are already in our late 50s and 60s. We will not be around forever and we must have the next team ready in the wings. The nucleus is there – brought in at the last elections and earlier. They have taken charge of important programmes like Our Singapore Conversation, like SG50 as well as different ministries, including difficult ones. They have connected with Singaporeans young and old and participated fully in the major decisions which we have made. But we need to reinforce them, to round out the team to give Singapore the best possible chance of succeeding into the future. And that is what I need to do in the next election.Singapore is at a turning point. We have just completed 50 successful years. Now we are starting out on our next 50 years of nationhood. Soon, I will be calling elections to ask for your mandate to take Singapore into this next phase of our nation-building. And this election will be critical. You will be deciding who is governing Singapore for the next five years; but more than that. You will be choosing the team who will be working with you for the next 15-20 years. You will be setting the direction for Singapore for the next 50 years. You will be determining the future for Singapore.
What will this future be? Will Singapore become an ordinary country, with intractable problems, slow or even negative growth; overspending; heavy burdens for our children; gridlocked government; unable to act? There are so many examples around the world. Or will Singapore always stay special for our children? A multi-racial society strengthened by diversity, not splintered by divisions. A rugged society where everyone strives to do his best, but looks out for his fellow men, a people who live up to our song “One People, One Nation, One Singapore”.
If you are proud of what we have achieved together, if you support what we want to do ahead, the future that we are building, then please support me, please support my team because my team and I cannot do anything just by ourselves. We have to do it with you in order to do it for you. In fact, we have to do it together in order to do it for all of us to do a good job for Singapore so that we can keep Singapore special for many years to come. Another 50 years.
Can I be sure that Singapore will still be doing well, still be special come SG100? Nobody can be sure. Nobody can promise that we will all live happily ever after. We all have our hopes and fears, our views and our guesses. One opinion that I know everybody would have liked to know was Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s. He is gone now, but some friends did ask him this question not too long ago.
In his old age, a group of friends would regularly take Mr Lee out for meals. The conversation would flow, and Mr Lee would get a chance to see a different bit of the Singapore he had built. The last time they had dinner together was in January this year, shortly before he was taken to hospital. After Mr Lee died, one of the friends wrote to me, describing what happened. Let me read her letter.
(Reads letter)As it was the start of 2015, we talked at length about the celebrations for SG50. We took turns to encourage Mr Lee to attend as many SG50 events as possible. Actually, we hoped he would be there for the SG50 National Day Parade. Mr Lee listened to our exhortations, but stopped short of saying yes to our suggestions. At each of our gatherings, it had become a tradition to ask Mr Lee “Will there be a Singapore many years from now?” Once, Mr Lee said “Maybe”. On another, Mr Lee said “Yes, if there is no corruption”.This was classic Mr Lee – ever-believing in Singapore, yet ever-cognisant that there was always work to be done, that we should never take things for granted. Continuing with our tradition and in the spirit of SG50, that evening we asked him “Will there be a Singapore 50 years from now?” Mr Lee’s answer took us all by surprise.
That evening, for the first time, Mr Lee said“Of course there will be … even better!”
(Ends letter)
Mr Lee did not make it to the SG50 NDP. But we were happy to have the three surviving ministers who signed the Separation Agreement at the Parade. Encik Othman Wok who is here with us this evening and Mr Ong Pang Boon and Mr Jek Yuen Thong. They sat in a place of honour, next to Mr Lee’s chair. When we watched the video tribute to Mr Lee, we were all moved. We could sense his spirit with us, and in us. Mr Lee would have been proud of what he had built, if he had seen the NDP.
Now he is no longer here, we are on our own, but we are ready. Our resolve to defend ourselves is unquestioned. Our spirit and confidence is robust. Our unity and identity as a people has never been stronger. At the NDP, we showed the world what stuff Singapore is made of.
For me, there were two special moments in the memorable parade. One was when Kit Chan sang “Home”. She sang beautifully, she always does. But what most amazed me was the singing from the crowd. All round the Padang, we could hear our voices lustily singing. “This is home, truly” and never before have we done that.
The second moment was after the parade. The last item the kids were in bright LED costumes putting on an energetic and spectacular performance. I went down to the Padang afterwards to meet them. They were in high spirits. Their faces shone with excitement and hope. I thought to myself these are the faces of the future of Singapore. 50 years from now, SG100, they will be about 60 years old – still vigorous with many more active years ahead of them. I hope they will be back at the Padang celebrating again, remembering SG50, congratulating one and another on how much they have done and how far they have come and looking at more young, radiant faces of children and many grandchildren and singing Majulah Singapura! Thank you very much!

   singaporewebsite update april",11863,"In his National Day Rally speech on August 23, 2015, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed Singapore's progress and future plans as the nation celebrated its Golden Jubilee. PM Lee highlighted the significant strides Singapore has made in defense, economic development, and social cohesion over the past 50 years. He emphasized the transformation from a vulnerable, newly independent state to a robust nation with a strong defense force, exemplified by the evolution from a modest military display in 1969 to a sophisticated showcase of military might in 2015.

PM Lee also discussed Singapore's economic transformation, noting the shift from a reliance on entrepot trade to becoming a global hub with world-class infrastructure like PSA and Changi Airport. He underscored the importance of housing development, particularly through the Housing Development Board (HDB), which has successfully provided quality living conditions and eradicated slums.

A significant portion of the speech was dedicated to social policies aimed at fostering a multi-racial, multi-religious society. PM Lee reiterated the commitment to multiracialism, mutual support, and self-reliance. He highlighted the introduction of policies such as SkillsFuture, aimed at lifelong learning and workforce development, and enhancements to social safety nets including healthcare and housing grants.

Looking forward, PM Lee outlined challenges and policy adjustments in areas such as aging, healthcare, and population management. He announced initiatives to support family life, such as enhancements to the Baby Bonus and paternity leave. PM Lee stressed the importance of maintaining a strong, united societal fabric and the continuous engagement of all communities to ensure every citizen progresses with the nation.

The speech not only reflected on past achievements but also set the agenda for future development, focusing on sustainability, social harmony, and continued economic dynamism, ensuring that Singapore remains a ""shining red dot"" on the global map."

* * * * *
My fellow Singaporeans, good evening again. A lot has happened since my last National Day Rally. We had a good General Election and now we have the next generation of leaders firmly in place. We have been working hard to lay the foundation for the next 50 years, SkillsFuture, the SG future conversations and projects, the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE).
This last month has been good for Singapore. The first NDP after SG50, in the new National Stadium, went well. In Rio, Team Singapore did us proud.
But while we celebrate, we should continue to prepare for our future.
Therefore tonight, I want to speak seriously about the challenges we face. My subjects will not all be easy or fun ones. Some sensitive topics may even make us feel a little bit uncomfortable. But it is my responsibility to talk candidly about them and tell you honestly what lies ahead. What we need to do to progress together.
I want to ask three questions. One, how do we progress together? Two, how do we secure our place in the world? And three, how do we ensure good politics for Singapore?
First question, how do we progress?
We aspire to be among the leading cities in the world, New York, Shanghai, London, Tokyo, Sydney. One of the shining spots in the world, in human civilization, where people want to be. Because here, you can do great things. A good place to bring up children where our young continue to enjoy opportunities and a better life.
At the same time, we want Singapore to be our home, where we belong, where our families feel safe and secure, where we build a compassionate and inclusive society, leaving no one behind.
We know what we want, but how do we get there?
Among all the economic issues we are dealing with, slower growth, helping people to upgrade, strengthening social safety nets - the defining challenge which we face in this era is disruption. Things are changing fast, old models are not working, new models are coming thick and fast and we are having to adjust and to keep up. Because of technology, globalisation, and the disruption will happen over and over again relentlessly.
I shall just use the familiar example of the taxi business. Uber and Grab, these are private car hire services. They compete with taxis in cities all over the world. You open an app, it matches you with the nearest car. The car comes, you can see it coming on your map, picks you up where you are, takes you where you need to go. You tap on the app again, you rate the driver, the driver rates you and you pay. No need to book a cab by phone, no need to hail a cruising cab along the street. I am sure some of you came by Uber or Grab tonight. Anybody? A few hands. Some of you must have taken Comfort and other taxis tonight. Anybody? Taxi drivers must be getting worried, but I am sure there are. How does Uber and Grab work? They grab data from users. They analyse the travel patterns, they adjust the charging to match supply and demand. So if there are lots of people wanting rides, not enough cars, fares goes up, more drivers turn up. If there are a lot of drivers, not enough rides, and fare goes down, maybe more people will turn up wanting to ride, maybe some drivers will go home. It is a new way of doing it and everywhere where there is Uber and Grab, or in China, Didi Kuaidi, and in other cites similar services with different names. They are disrupting the taxi industry. Disrupting, but commuters are benefitting. Better service, more responsive, faster. But taxi companies and drivers find their business affected. In some cities like London, or Sydney, or Jakarta, or Paris, the drivers have staged protests, blockades. They want the governments to block the new services, to protect their existing ways of doing business.
What do we do in Singapore? We can respond to disruptive change like this in two ways. We can close ourselves off, try to stop people from using the new technology. You must do things the way you have always done it. So Uber out, Grab out. Any new services coming along, no to it too. We impose restrictions, we protect their old ways, the taxi companies and we force everybody to stick to that. But we will be left behind and our commuters will lose out and our economy will suffer. The other way is to embrace change. Let the disruption happen. You cannot stop it but you can adjust to it. Let the commuters enjoy better service but help the incumbents and especially help the taxi drivers to adapt to the changes. That is what we are doing. We are updating the rules to foster fair competition while protecting commuters. We require all the drivers whether taxis, Uber, Grab or anybody else, you must have the right insurance, you must have clean records.
As we adjust the rules, the companies will have to adapt and they can adapt. I think the taxi drivers are watching this very carefully. I know quite a few are feeling anxious. I talked to Ang Hin Kee who often brings them to his grassroots events. I talked to them directly and they asked what is going to happen? Will they still have a livelihood? I said you can also drive for the other side. They said yes, but we have to work hard. But they can still make a living. Our taxi drivers have been level-headed about the competition. They have talked to us, they have made useful recommendations on how to level the playing field. Some of you have actually told me that you welcome the competition because now that you can go to the other side, the taxi companies are taking the taxi drivers more seriously and responding with better offers, new technology, enabling you to compete. On the other side, we also talked to the new operators and the new operators tell us, it is not so easy to compete in Singapore because unlike other cities, in Singapore, the taxi business is quite efficient. It is competitive, the drivers work hard and so, they have to work hard to get their share of the pie. So there is competition. The playing field is in play. Not quite level. Taxis still have some extra rules. They have to drive a minimum mileage every day. I know this is a sore point. There are other statutory requirements which make taxis more expensive to operate. But then I remind the taxi drivers you also enjoy some advantages. As a driver told me, they can ‘sweep the floor’. I said, “What does that mean, ‘sweep the floor’?” That means you can pick up from the kerb. Uber and Grab cannot do street hails. There are other advantages too so we will progressively sort all these things out. But I think we all know that we cannot stop progress and even Uber and Grab are going to be disrupted and the next round, maybe no drivers but instead, driverless cars running a taxi service. In fact in Singapore next year, we are going to start a trial of driverless taxis in One-North.
So the same thing is happening in other industries as well, like retail. Shopping habits are changing, people are going online. Used to buy groceries from FairPrice. Now, you can shop online, somebody may go to the shop for you, collect it for you and deliver the goods to you the next day to your doorstep or maybe to lockers in your neighbourhood for online retailers like this POPStation. People are also buying from overseas stores, Amazon, Taobao, which has wider range and often cheaper. Orchard Road shops are affected. They have become places where people look, see, and go home to buy. You can still do business, but different and not so easy. The retail business is very big in Singapore, 125,000 workers, 16,000 companies. As retail gets disrupted, we have to anticipate what is coming, we have to help companies and workers to adapt. But it is not just doom and gloom because when you disrupt, you also create new jobs. Like now, if people order online, it still has to come to you, either to the box or to the house. So the delivery vans doing delivery service, they will have business. As a transport and financial hub, if people are buying online all over Southeast Asia and Asia, we can be in that business. The goods ship through Singapore, the financing has to be done somewhere, we can be a major player in this new logistics chain. There will be new opportunities, data analytics, digital marketing, figuring out who is buying what, who is interested in which item, how to get the item to the person who wants it.
Every industry is disrupted, but every industry is disrupted differently. So Economic Development Board (EDB), SPRING, Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), International Enterprise Singapore (IE Singapore) will work with these industries one by one, with the trade associations, with the chambers of commerce, to develop specific programs to help the companies, to use new technologies, to invest in skills.
At the same time we also need an overall strategy to find out, to be able to spot whether changes are coming from, to respond when things are disrupted and to keep our economy growing. So that our companies can be resilient, able to keep on finding new ways to do business, able to keep on employing Singaporeans in good jobs. And we have to prepare our workers to do good jobs, different jobs, new jobs, during their lives.
That is what the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) is doing. CFE is chaired by Heng Swee Keat and Iswaran.
It is not quite done but I will give you a preview of three of the themes from the CFE project.
Building New Capabilities
First, to build new capabilities.
Secondly, to promote entrepreneurship. And thirdly, to develop new skills amongst our people. First of all, we will help our companies to develop new capabilities. And one area where we can do this, which is promising, is digital. Because Singapore is well-connected, we have got fibre everywhere and our people are IT savvy. You just look at this. Where do you think this is and what do you think they are doing? Somebody did that in the audience. That is a Pokemon and Pokemon Go has gone viral. But it shows that everybody has a phone, everybody is online, everybody is comfortable, able to use digital and I think there are opportunities in digital. It is virtual, it does not require large areas of land, it will save labour and we can do business with anyone from anywhere.
We have already got companies doing interesting things in the digital space. Like Ascent Solutions. It is a logistics small and medium enterprise (SME). In the logistics business, there are two major problems. One, delays in customs clearance because when you go from border to border, somebody wants to look inside your box. And secondly, theft. That means pilferage or maybe the whole container disappears. So Ascent Solutions came up with a digital solution. They were backed by SPRING and they developed a tracking device and a lock called iSpot. The iSpot is a lock on the container which has a Global Positioning System (GPS) inside. Secure, tamper-proof and you can be sure that what is inside stays inside and what is outside does not get inside. There is no need for the customs officers to inspect the box over and over again. The owner can track where the box is, all the time, 24/7. So with IE Singapore’s support, Ascent has taken to East Africa and there are more 10,000 iSpots in East Africa. From Kenya to Uganda, it used to take 20 days to travel because there are ten checkpoints to clear along the way. Each time you wait and you may have to grease palms. But now, no need to clear customs over and over again because of the tamper-proof lock. In two days, you get there. It is a game-changer. I am very proud that a Singapore company is doing good business in Africa with help from IE.
Besides digital we also need to build capabilities in other sectors. We have some SMEs which can compete with the best in the world and we should help them to grow, to scale up. I mentioned Fragrance Bak Kwa and Luzerne just now in my Chinese speech but we can also hold our own in engineering.
HOPE Technik is a home-grown engineering SME that has been making a name for itself. It is ten years old now and it employs 110 people. You know some of the things they make because they make Red Rhinos and Hazmat Control Vehicles for Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). They also make drones and specialised industrial and commercial equipment.
Four years ago, HOPE Technik won a tender by Airbus. They beat top engineering firms in the world for this tender and their job was to build a scale model of a spaceplane. A spaceplane is a combination of a spaceship and an airplane. It is a scale model for Airbus’ civilian spacecraft programme. They built it, they loaded it with sensors, they tested it successfully, took it high up in the air, flew it down instrumentally. It is part of the research towards building a real spaceplane. So maybe in 20 years’ time when civilians go into space and spaceflight is a reality for all of us, then we can say a Singaporean firm helped this to happen.
Today, HOPE Technik is building autonomous robots, used in different settings; semiconductor plants, logistics warehouses, hospitals. They navigate themselves, open doors, go around obstacles, and avoid bumping into people
HOPE Technik focuses sharply on engineering, which it applies to niche areas. It is able to create opportunities for itself, it is able to find new markets, and it is able to create new jobs for Singaporeans. We must build this sort of new, deep capabilities in every sector, engineering, food manufacturing, logistics, and the Government will support companies to do so.
Promote Entrepreneurship
Beyond building up capabilities, we should also promote entrepreneurship. Because engineering is one thing but entrepreneurship, that dare to try something new, to venture. That is a different mindset and entrepreneurs have that mindset, need that mindset and we need people like that in our society. They play an important role, not just because they are doing business for themselves and doing well and creating jobs and prosperity and making it big. But also because they are resourceful, they are optimistic. They give the society a confidence. Anything is possible, anything you can do, and I will try and do better. And we need that mindset in Singapore. Through our own actions, we can change the world. And if we fail, we try again. If we fail, we try again. We refuse to give up. We keep on trying. One day, we will succeed.
We started a small experiment at Block 71 Ayer Rajah five years ago. Block 71 was about to be demolished. Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) decided instead, do not knock it down. Renovate it, launch it as an incubator. An incubator is a building which offers spaces for rent to entrepreneurs to start companies. This blue building, this one, is Block 71. It looks like an old JTC building with a new coat of paint. But a lot of bright ideas inside. We were offering not just buildings and their services, but also co-funding from government agencies. It started with a small group of start-ups. It has been very successful. Now, it has expanded to Block 73 and Block 79. So now they have changed the name and they have called it JTC Launchpad. We even have a Block 71 in San Francisco to help our start-ups tap the United States (US) market and the Silicon Valley network. I visited Block 71, both here in Ayer Rajah and also in San Francisco (SF). This one is talking to our young people in SF. Many of them starting their own companies.
One company which came out of the original Block 71 is Zimplistic. Zimplistic makes the Rotimatic. The Rotimatic is the world’s first automatic Chapati and Roti maker. You put in the flour, you put in the oil, you put in the water, and you press a button and after a minute, out comes fresh hot Chapati and Roti, one per minute. And if you have made Chapati you will know what hard work it is. In the old days, the women did the work, but nowadays the women are out at work, so they do not have time to make Chapati any more every day. But with the Rotimatic, the family can still have Chapati for dinner. The Rotimatic was developed by Ms Pranoti Nagarkar. She is a mechanical engineer by training and her husband, Rishi, who does the software. They brought it to market with SPRING’s help. It has generated a lot of interest internationally and later on, you can try Rotimatic Chapati at the reception and tell Pranoti and Rishi what you think about it.
Our schools are giving our students exposure to start-up hotspots all over the world. National University of Singapore (NUS) has overseas colleges in lots of places, including in the Silicon Valley, and I will just show you, these are some of the places, guess where? This one is Fudan in Shanghai. This one is Stanford in San Francisco, or near San Francisco. This one is in Tel Aviv, you can see the Hebrew street sign. But we are all over – New York, Beijing, Munich, Lausanne, and Stockholm. Students go there and they have a chance to attend classes at universities there. They interact with start-up founders and angel investors. They intern at the start-ups there and they may get bitten by the bug and start something, try to change the world.
It is still early days, but it looks promising. The start-ups are growing, and the investors are paying attention. Venture capitalists and some of the big tech companies are coming here, like Google, Paypal and Facebook. They are setting up engineering things here because they see promising talent and interesting start-ups. And maybe the next Google, Facebook or Alibaba may come from Singapore.
Developing Skills
A strong economy, therefore, needs capabilities. You need the entrepreneurs, but you also need a skilled workforce and if we give our workforce skills, we will enable them to hold better jobs, earn better pay. And that is why SkillsFuture is crucial.
We are preparing our students well for the new economy, equipping them with relevant skills which are in demand. Our polytechnics and ITEs offer courses in digital media design and lots of these students intern at film studios like Ubisoft, Bandai Namco, Blizzard, and Lucasfilm. Eventually, some of them work there. There are also other courses to train horticulturalists, food scientists, sports scientists – all sorts of new jobs which a generation ago did not really exist. Opportunities are also opening up in cross-disciplinary areas. You study one thing, you combine that skill with something else and you create something valuable. Take Sarah Salim, she graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a degree in Visual Design. She started a publishing firm doing graphic design. Now she works with GovTech@Hive and she is applying her design skills to produce data visualisations on data.gov.sg, which is where you can find all the government information. Here is something she is working on. I will show you just one example, just for fun. This shows you the activities in ActiveSG gyms during the week – weekdays, which day, which hour, when is it crowded, when it is not. You look at Bishan, it is 62 percent occupied. This shows the occupancy level on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 7.00am to 9.00pm. You can see the most popular timeslots are in the evening, the most popular days are the weekends. So, at a spot, you can see what is happening. You compare Bishan with Bedok, Clementi, Jurong West and the average gym. How are they doing? I think Bishan is working harder than the rest. Bedok and Jurong West have gone on a tea break. So, you need to make things visible, graphic, vivid and simple to understand. You need a lot of skill and hard work. So, to produce a chart like this, you need graphic designers like Sarah, contributing to our Smart Nation. Sarah will be having a baby, so, we should congratulate her too.
For those people who are already working, to help them, we are offering courses to upgrade their skills and to achieve deeper mastery. SkillsFuture offers all sorts of courses, nursing, precision engineering and pre-school education. Not just courses, but pathways to upgrade yourself in your job. That is what Madam Janessa Puvaneswari Kumaran is doing. She became a pre-school teacher with the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) about ten years ago. Now, she is a Senior Teacher and she has taken up the SkillsFuture Study Award to do an Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Leadership at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Janessa aspires to become a centre principal. I am sure she will get there and become a great Early Childhood Educator.
Besides upgrading workers in their present careers, we are also helping workers who get retrenched, or who change careers, to transition and find new jobs. It is tough to lose your job, especially when you are young or when you are not so young and you have family to support. But there is help available. Programmes under Adapt and Grow, the Professional Conversion Programmes, and the Career Support Programme (CSP). They train you, help you to pick up new skills, move to a different industry, and settle into a new job.
NTUC is doing good work, helping not just rank-and-file workers but PMEs too, like Gerard Peck. Gerard worked 30 years at a bank in IT security, now in his 50s. He left the bank last year. He found it hard to find a new job so he signed up for the CSP. The CSP helped his new employer pay a portion of his wages for some time. It made it easier for his new employer to take him on. With e2i’s help, Gerard landed a job as Head of IT at another company early this year. The company is Datapost. Datapost is an SME in printing and mailing solutions. It is the biggest print bureau in the region. Gerard has found his former banking experience useful, helping Datapost to transform their IT system and developing new business strategies for Datapost. Well done!
I have talked about developing capabilities, encouraging entrepreneurship and developing skills. Earlier in my Chinese speech, I also discussed strengthening our safety nets. These are the ways our economy and our workers can thrive amidst disruption. This is how we can progress together and thrive in a competitive and dangerous world. It is a dangerous world.
My second question is, how do we secure our place in the world?
To start off with, we have to defend ourselves and that is why we have the Singapore Armed Forces.
But as a small country, we also need a network of friends. Friends in our neighbourhood and also friends among the big powers all over the world, even in faraway places.
We are a little bit like Mongolia. I visited Mongolia one month ago. Area-wise, they are bigger than us, population-wise, about the same as us. But similar, because their two neighbours, are much bigger than them. One is China, the other is Russia. If you ask the Mongolians how many neighbours they have, they will tell you they have three neighbours, China and Russia. Who is the third neighbour? The “third neighbour” is Japan, the US, the South Koreans and the EU. These are all Mongolia’s “third neighbours”.
In the same way, Singapore also has two neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, and we have “third neighbours” all over the world. I have been busy with foreign trips this year because the world is important and we have to keep up links with them. Beyond Malaysia and Indonesia, our most important relationships are with China and with America.
US and China
I just came back from an Official Visit to the US at the invitation of President Obama. It was a significant gesture. The last time a Singapore PM was officially welcomed in the White House with ceremonies was more than 30 years ago when Mr Lee Kuan Yew went in 1985. My visit reflects Singapore's warm and deep friendship with America, spanning many areas: economics, education, defence, security, people to people ties. We benefit from the dynamic and innovative US economy. We admire their warmth, openness and generosity. My visit was also a signal that the US values its friends and partners and appreciates Singapore support for the role that America has played in the Asia-Pacific for more than 70 years since the war, spreading prosperity through trade and investments, maintaining security and stability, enabling all the countries in the region to thrive and to compete peacefully. Singapore hopes that the US would keep on doing this even as China's influence grows.
At the same time, Singapore is good friends with China. I will be visiting China next month, including to Chongqing, where we have a third government-to-government project with China. Singapore hopes that China will develop and grow well too because an unstable and backward China will cause Asia great trouble, as happened in the 1950s and 1960s. Over the last 40 years, China has reformed and opened up under Deng Xiaoping and his successors. China has been stable and prosperous and this has greatly benefited Asia and the world, including Singapore.
We are happy to see China grow strong and influential in a constructive and peaceful way.
Therefore, we are friends with both America and with China. It is easiest to do this if the two countries are on good terms with each other and, in fact, both countries do aim to be on good terms with each other. Both believe that the Pacific is vast enough to accommodate both powers and President Xi Jinping said recently that America and China should “cultivate common circles of friends”. That is precisely what Singapore's trying to do, to be among America's circles of friends, and also among China’s circle of friends.
But life is never so straightforward. First of all, we may ourselves have some issue or other with these countries, as we did with the US when we caned Michael Fay for vandalism, and we have had issues with China too from time to time when they felt that we did not sufficiently defer to their interests. Also, sometimes the interests of our friends will conflict and we will be pressured to choose sides.
One current issue which can cause trouble is the South China Sea. It is a complicated dispute. At one level, it is a dispute among parties who claim all or some of the islands and the reefs in the South China Sea. At another level, it is about the rights of the international community, provided for under UNCLOS, The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, rights such as freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight. It is also about how international disputes and disagreements can be peacefully resolved. Now, if you do not fully understand what it is about, just remember this. This is a dispute which is very complicated because it is a dispute where even what is in dispute is itself disputed. It is true, the lawyers will tell you so. What is mine is not in dispute, what is yours is in dispute.
Singapore happens to be the country coordinator for the ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations now and this puts us in a slightly warm seat warm because each party wants us to side a bit more with them. It is not possible for us to side with everybody at once. We are doing our best to be an honest broker, dealing straight with all parties.
Now, where do all these countries stand? Let me try and give you a sense of it. China claims the “nine-dash line”. These dashes are the “nine-dash line”. There are four ASEAN countries which have overlapping claims in the South China Sea – Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. The claims overlap with China, and with one another. The US does not have claims in the South China Sea, but they do have interests at stake because freedom of navigation and overflight are very important to them, including through the South China Sea.
Three years ago, the Philippines launched a case against China under The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. China refused to participate, but the Tribunal heard the case, and issued its award in July. The award said that China's claim to historic rights within the “nine-dash line” is incompatible with UNCLOS. China rejected the tribunal's jurisdiction and also categorically rejected the award as null and void.
What is Singapore's interest and stand? We do not have any claims of our own in the South China Sea. We are right here, very far away, even Pedra Branca is right here. We have no claims of our own. We do not take sides on other claims. China, Philippines, the other claimants. But in other ways, we do have a lot at stake and three things matter to us, international law, freedom of navigation and a united ASEAN.
Upholding international law and the peaceful settlement of disputes, is a vital interest for a small country like Singapore. When we have disputes with other countries that is how we settle them. With Malaysia, when there was a quarrel over Pedra Branca, we agreed to take it to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Singapore secured a favourable result, both sides accepted the ruling. We had another dispute with Malaysia over the development charge issue in the Points of Agreement on Railway Land. I agreed with PM Najib to submit it to arbitration. The ruling went against Singapore, but we both accepted it and we moved on. We did not let it affect our relationship with Malaysia or my personal ties with PM Najib. And that is how international disputes should be settled. However, in reality, big powers do not always act like that. Big powers can insist on their own interests and often do. They do not submit to adjudication by international tribunals, they may not comply with their rulings and China is not the only country to do this and nor is this the first time something like this has happened. Nevertheless, Singapore must support and strive for a rules-based international order. We have to depend on words and treaties. They mean everything to us. We cannot afford to have international relations work on the basis that might is right. If rules do not matter, then small countries like Singapore have no chance of survival.
Our second interest in the South China Sea is freedom of navigation. I will explain why. Take a look at the map. Singapore is this little spot down here, a little red dot. We have two vital sea lanes of communication, two arteries. One through the South China Sea, the other, through the Straits of Malacca. Ships come from Europe, the Suez Canal, they come to through the south, Straits of Malacca, pass Singapore, up the South China Sea to Japan, the Far East and vice versa. Both of these are arteries. You block one, you die; likewise with air routes. It is important to us that disputes in the South China Sea do not affect freedom of navigation or overflight by ships or aircraft.
Thirdly, Singapore needs a united and effective ASEAN. With five million people, Singapore’s voice internationally, counts for not much. But collectively, ASEAN with more than 600 million people, it can make itself heard better. This is provided ASEAN is united. On the South China Sea issue, ASEAN finds it very hard to take a common stand because the members have different interests. Some are close to China, like Laos and Cambodia. Others, like Philippines and Thailand, are treaty allies of the United States. Some are claimant states in the South China Sea, others are not. Some do not even have a coastline in the South China Sea, like Myanmar. Myanmar is not in the South China Sea. They are on the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean. ASEAN has got different interests and it is very hard to come together. But the trouble is if ASEAN cannot deal with a major issue at its doorstep affecting its members, in the long run, nobody will take ASEAN seriously and that will be very bad for all of the members of ASEAN, and for Singapore, too.
So, on the South China Sea, we have got our own stand, principled, consistent; different from China’s, different from the Philippines or America. Other countries will persuade us to side with them, one side or the other, and we have to choose our own place to stand, what is in our interest, calculate it, choose the spot, stand firm, we cannot succumb to pressure.
I tell you this so that you will understand why we do what we do and why we have to stand up for Singapore's position. Sometimes, if you read the foreign media, including the PRC media, you will find articles criticizing Singapore for not siding more with them and I know some Singaporeans are concerned about these criticisms because they have foreign friends. PRC friends, business partners, academic colleagues, personal contacts. They may tell you any tension between Singapore and China will affect your business, affect your collaboration. I understand these concerns. We would like business and collaboration to continue, too, to flourish between Singapore and China and Singapore and other countries because these are arrangements which benefit both sides. If they are disrupted, both sides lose. But the Government has to take a national point of view, decide what is in Singapore's overall interests. We want good relations with other countries if it is at all possible, but we must also be prepared for ups and downs from time to time.
Singapore has a reputation to protect, that we have our own independent, carefully-thought-out stand. We cooperate with other countries but we make our own calculations, and that is what makes us credible, consistent, reliable, valuable to others, to ASEAN partners, to the powers – America, China Europe. It has taken us a long time to build up this reputation and we have to be very careful to maintain it.
Our relationship with China is much broader than the South China Sea. The friendship has lasted for decades, we have done major G-to-G projects with them. We have the Suzhou Industrial Park, the Tianjin Eco-City. If you look at the flats, it looks like HDB flats because that is where the inspiration came from. And now we have a Chongqing Connectivity Initiative (CCI), a third government-to-government project to support China's Western region development strategy. We engage with many different provinces and cities. We are pursuing opportunities in infrastructure, in connectivity, financial services, urban planning, clean technology, working with China on One Belt, One Road, participating in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. We have many more opportunities to strengthen our friendship and cooperation with each other. That is how we do business.
Malaysia and Indonesia
Nearer home, our most important partners – Malaysia, Indonesia. We work hard to build up all ties with them, but these are sensitive and complex relationships. From time to time, there will be differences because of their deep-seated attitudes towards us. You may have read recently one Indonesian minister declared he was not afraid of Singapore because ‘it is just a small country’. It is an abang attitude towards us. It has not changed since we became independent, but we must not let these difficulties affect our broader bilateral cooperation.
On the whole today, our relations with Malaysia and Indonesia are good. With Malaysia, I settled the Point of Agreement on railway land with Prime Minister Najib – 20 years of trying, finally, we succeeded and settled it. Last month, I was in Putrajaya to witness the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the High-Speed Rail between Singapore and Malaysia. PM Najib hosted us to lunch. The durian was good. The High-Speed Rail will be better. With Indonesia, I meet President Jokowi regularly, including once over nasi lemak. We want to work with Indonesia to tackle transboundary haze, to deal with the companies causing it and he has told me he is committed to solving the haze problem. We have also been discussing enhancing economic cooperation, encouraging Singapore companies to invest more in Indonesia and including to refresh our longstanding cooperation in BBK (Batam, Bintan, Karimun) in the Riau Islands just close to Singapore. Next week, on Thursday, I am having a leaders’ retreat with President Jokowi.1 It is going to be in Semarang, which is in Java, Central Java. We are going there because SembCorp has a joint venture there to build an industrial park – Kendal Industrial Park. It is the first major industrial investment by a Singapore company outside Batam. I am going to be opening it with President Jokowi and I hope that it will encourage more Singaporeans to go and to find opportunities in Indonesia.
It is going to mean a more complicated world for us. Less tranquil and we have to be more watchful.
PM Lee
Terrorism
One urgent issue where we have to cooperate with our neighbours is terrorism. It is on our minds now. Almost every day, we read of new attacks somewhere: US, Europe, the Middle East; closer to home, Indonesia and Malaysia, too. We are seeing “lone wolf” attacks by self-radicalised individuals. They go online, they get led astray, they plan something by themselves then they mount an attack, and murder innocent people. You have the truck rampage in Nice, the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and many more attacks, each one heart-breaking, shocking, yet each time no longer a real surprise. Such attacks are almost impossible to prevent completely because they are inspired by ISIS. But there is no group involved planning and executing it. So it is just one person, two persons, it is much harder for the security forces to discover and prevent these attacks.
The terrorist groups are active all around us in Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, you have read about the arrests of Gigih Rahmat Dewa and his group in Batam. They were planning to attack Singapore, to fire a rocket to hit Marina Bay Sands from Batam. Now, speaking as a former artilleryman, I will tell you it is not so easy to fire one rocket and hit one building 20km away. Can be done, but not easy. But the trouble is if you fire one rocket at Singapore and you miss Marina Bay Sands, you may hit something else. We have to take this very seriously. Furthermore, how do you now this was the only thing he was planning and he did not have other dark thoughts on how to attack Singapore? Can you be sure that every last terrorist in the group has been arrested?
Last December, the Indonesians were expecting attacks over Christmas and New Year. They had intelligence on it. They went out of their way to pick up, arrest the groups and disrupt the attacks. They nearly succeeded. They picked up all of the groups, cleaned up all the terrorist cells, except one, and that one cell evaded the dragnet. In January, they mounted an attack in Jakarta. Fortunately, not so successful, but still a couple of people died. In Malaysia, there was a grenade attack in Puchong, near Putrajaya, in June. It was ordered by a Malaysian militant in Syria. But even long before this, the Malaysian authorities knew they had problems because they had arrested around 200 ISIS supporters, including at least 13 Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) personnel. Armed forces people, trained and pre-trained. Last month, Malaysia found that seven prison wardens had been radicalised by their detainees. You lock up a chap up, the chap subverts your jailor. The wardens had to be sent for de-radicalization. It reminded me of what happened in the 1950s when we locked up the pro-communist left-wing activists and they did the same thing. They subverted their jailors in Changi Prison. That is why we had to change the jailors and put in Gurkha guards, do not speak Chinese and so cannot be subverted. There are perhaps 1,000 Malaysians and Indonesians in the Middle East fighting with ISIS. It is enough for ISIS to form a Bahasa-speaking battalion. It is called the Katibah Nusantara, or the Archipelago Battalion, meaning the Malay Archipelago. One of the leaders is Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian. The one who ordered the Christmas and New Year attacks in Jakarta. ISIS has a magazine, Al-Fatihin, published by a media agency which is its friend, in Bahasa Indonesia. We have had to ban that magazine recently. ISIS itself puts out propaganda videos in Bahasa. It shows child fighters training with firearms. These are children of Malaysian and Indonesian fighters, and it shows the Malaysian and Indonesian fighters beheading hostages on the video so as to impress possible recruits and get more people to join them from Southeast Asia.
In Singapore, we are taking this absolutely seriously. It is not just an external threat around us, it can also be, and it is, a domestic issue because Singaporeans are not uniquely immune to jihadist propaganda. We have arrested a dozen Singaporeans who have been radicalised over the last year or two. Some have surfed jihadist websites. Some listened to extremist radio stations in our region. Some were radicalized by friends. Most were self-radicalised. Several tried to go the Middle East to join ISIS and a few succeeded and they are still there. There were a few who were prepared to mount attacks on Singapore, including one who was trying to go to Syria. And if he could not get there, he would do something here and try to kill either the President or the PM. We continue to pick up a steady trickle of such people, one or two a month, and just these last two days, you would have seen the news that the police have dealt with four Singaporeans who had been radicalized and were planning to go to Syria – three with family connections and a fourth one with a link to Batam.
So, Gigih’s plot to attack MBS is not the only definite plan by terrorists to attack targets in Singapore that we know of. We know there have been others. We have quietly acted on the information. We have taken precautions, stepped up patrols, and raised protection for major events, for prominent premises. Sometimes, we have shifted and rescheduled events because of these threats. We take it seriously. It is not certain enough to warn everybody publicly, but serious enough for us to act quietly. So, the next time you see a patrol in the city, or some extra security in some areas, maybe we are just taking precautions or doing a show of force as deterrence, but it could also be in response to a real threat that we have heard about.
Fortunately, we have not been attacked so far. But what happens when the terrorists get through, and an attack occurs in Singapore? If the terrorists come from abroad, I think it may be easier for us to stand together, but if the terrorist is domestic, Singaporean, one of our own, self-radicalised, like what happened in Nice, where the truck driver was a French. I think our multiracial society will come under tremendous strain. Then, how do we react?
There are two possible things which can happen if you look at other countries. One, people stand up, stand together, show a collective will, refuse to be cowed after an attack. People helping one another, even strangers, like what happened in Paris after the major attack last November. The Parisians stepped up to offer shelter and free taxi rides to those who were stranded. They donated blood at hospitals. Muslims and non-Muslims came together, defied the terrorists and resolved to carry on with life normally – “we will not be cowed.” That is one reaction. But you also see another reaction – distrust, suspicion, fear, different communities fear and blame each other, racial attacks go up. In Paris last year, you saw some of this too, mosques and Muslim shops vandalised. Muslims physically assaulted, especially women and girls wearing religious attire.
Then the question is: which will happen in Singapore? That answer to the question comes down to our collective resolve to stand together with one another. That, in turn, depends on how well we prepare ourselves now before an attack; prepare ourselves to build trust, to strengthen bonds, to maintain and expand our common space so that instinctively, we feel one people.
One big plus which Singapore has is that our religious and community leaders have taken courageous stands. They condemn terrorist attacks, they refute extremist views. They make it clear that terrorists do not represent Islam, nor do they represent Singapore Muslims. They lead by example, they guide their flocks, their communities to stand together.
They also understand that ours is a multi-racial society. There has to be give and take. Each community has to engage and understand each other. It must not segregate itself from other communities. We have to respect one another’s religions, we cannot treat other groups as infidels.
If religious groups did the opposite, take an exclusivist approach, discourage interaction, contact with others, we will deepen our fault lines and weaken our society. Imagine, if in Singapore, only the Chinese wished each other 新年快乐; only Muslims could say Selamat Hari Raya to each another; only Indians, Hindus exchanged Deepavali greetings, and only Christians said Merry Christmas. It would be a very different, a very troubled Singapore.
It is fundamental that all religions in Singapore practise their faith in a multiracial and multi-religious context. Tolerant, give-and-take, respectful, warm. It has to be so here but it is not so in many other countries. It may be the same religion, but their practice and their teaching varies from country to country. Sometimes, these practices and teachings are exclusivist, intolerant. So, when we get foreign preachers visiting Singapore, if they do not understand our context and they want to preach these exclusivist practices and doctrines, they would cause us serious problems. So, we have to act against them and from time to time, we have acted against them. So, we have banned such preachers from coming in – Christians some, Hindus some, Muslims also some.
Our Muslim leaders have expressed concerns to us about such Muslim preachers. I am glad they are vigilant, making sure that the Islam, preached and practised in Singapore suits our multiracial context. That is why MUIS and PERGAS have the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS), to ensure that our religious teachers and scholars are reliable guides for the community. Already, about 80 percent of our asatizahs are recognised.
We need to strengthen the ARS. I welcome the call from the Malay/Muslim community leaders yesterday to make the ARS compulsory. That means all the asatizahs must be registered under the ARS and those who are educated abroad should attend a professional development course before they get registered so that they understand our local context. I support these proposals. I commend the Malay/Muslim community because they have taken the initiative to deal with a sensitive problem. With these measures, it will ensure that all the asatizahs in Singapore understand how Islam is practised here, and how you can guide Muslims and your students to live in harmony with other Singaporeans of all races and religions.
It is a very challenging landscape security-wise. The region is shifting. There are new dynamics between the powers and within ASEAN. It is going to mean a more complicated world for us. Less tranquil and we have to be more watchful. We have terrorism threatening our safety and our social fabric.
We have diplomats, security forces, Home Team, SAF doing good work but they by themselves alone cannot guarantee our security and safety or hold us together. Each of us have to do our part by understanding our national interests, supporting Singapore in our relations with other countries, preparing ourselves to deal with terrorism, standing together before and after an attack.
I am launching SG-Secure and the SG-Secure movement, in September. It is a call to action to be sensitised, trained and mobilised, for all of us to protect Singapore against an attack.
Ultimately, what matters most is that we must have that resolve to hold together, to fight, and to defend our place in the world.
You must have a sound political system and people must feel that this is theirs.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
This brings me to the third question: “How do we make sure that we have good politics in Singapore?”
We have described the strategies to progress together and to keep our place in the world.
But to have all these plans work, we must have good politics. If the political system malfunctions, we fail to produce good leaders, whom we trust and work with; or we cannot work together amongst ourselves and we are divided, then all our best laid plans will go to naught.
If you had followed the news, you will know about the Brexit referendum, the referendum in the United Kingdom on whether or not to stay in the EU. Brexit is short for “Britain Exit”. It is a vivid reminder of how important good politics is. In the end, the British voted to leave. It is already affecting them. The UK economy is down, Pound down, jobs moving out. But the bigger impact is on their social cohesion, fault lines in their society, between the young and old in Britain. The young want to look to Europe, the old want to stay – “Little Britain”. Between the better educated and the working class. Between the British and the immigrants. Even among the British, between the English and the Scots. The English want to leave, the Scots want to stay. But they voted and the consequences are there.
Why did it happen? Voters lost faith, lost faith in their leaders, in their whole political class. A lot of the population felt that they were not benefitting from globalisation. London did, the provinces did not. The educated prospered, the working class did not. Immigration was a problem. A lot of people came in and they felt they were not under control. In the referendum before the vote, people promised all kinds of things to work up the vote. It is easy to promise. After that, the morning after you have to pay the bill. During the campaign, you may have seen this famous campaign bus with “Vote Leave”. The bus had a big banner that said, “We send the EU 350 million pounds a week, let us fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave. Let us take back control.” Morning after the vote, after they won, 350 million pounds was struck out, became a typo, a mistake. The leaders denied it, the website wiped clean and Nigel Farage, who led the UK Independence Party, one of the leaders of “Leave”, resigned. He said he had achieved his life ambition. He wanted to see UK vote to leave. Now that they had voted to leave, he is done. What follows, somebody else can look after that. Thank you very much, I am retiring. It is amusing, if it were not so tragic. But it is people’s future, country’s future at stake, decided in campaigns like this, in the end, settled by a 52 percent of the vote.
These are anxieties and pressures which build up in Britain. But they are not just in Britain. Other countries too. Europe, America, even Asia.
Can it happen here? It could, unless we can make ourselves different.
How to make ourselves different? You need good leaders, you need politics which work, politics which would unite the country, and leaders who are attuned to what people want, the people’s aspirations. You must have a sound political system and people must feel that this is theirs. They have a stake, this is mine, Singapore, and we will fight to defend it. Then, the system can work.
We have a good system today. Parliamentary, inherited from the British, amended, modified, made to work in Singapore. So, we have NCMPs, NMPs, and more diverse voices in Parliament. GRCs, multiracial politics, and many other changes, big and small.
Review of the elected Presidency
One major change was to make the President an elected office. The President is the Head of State and the symbol of the nation. In addition, he has been given an important role: he holds the second key over reserves and appointments. Therefore instead of being chosen by Parliament, he has to be elected by the people of Singapore.
We have operated this two-key system for 25 years, and made many adjustments to it. But some aspects have not been revised and we need to bring them up to date.
In January, I appointed a Constitutional Commission, chaired by the Chief Justice, to review three things: To consider how the President can give more weight to the Council of Presidential Advisers (CPA); to update the criteria for somebody to be a candidate to be President; and to make sure that minorities regularly have a chance to become President.
Last week, the Commission submitted their report to me and they made recommendations in all three areas to improve the current arrangements. We are still studying the report. We will release it soon. In principle, we accept its main recommendations. Thereafter, we will publish a White Paper on how exactly we will implement the changes, then we will table a Constitutional Amendment Bill in Parliament and when the Bill comes up for Second Reading, for the debate, we will have a full debate.
Tonight, I do not want to talk about any of the details, specific recommendations. I just want to explain the principles: why are we doing this, why are we reviewing the presidency, why we need to make changes.
Strengthening the CPA
The first one, on the Council of Presidential Advisers, is the most straightforward. When we designed the scheme, we designed it like that – you have a President, he is elected, but he does not act alone. He is advised by a council of wise men – the Council of Presidential Advisers. So, when he makes decisions, he will have the benefit of the experience and judgement of the CPA. We expected to improve the CPA and strengthen the CPA over time as it became more established. The arrangements have worked well and so, the changes being proposed are incremental and straightforward.
Qualifying Criteria
The second thing we are reviewing is the qualifying criteria to become a candidate to become President.
The President’s job is to decide on major matters: on money, on appointments. We have built up reserves over the years. We need to make sure that the government of the day will spend within its means, and not fritter away reserves accumulated by previous generations and governments. A clean, competent public service is one of our unique strengths and enduring competitive advantages. We need to make doubly sure that people appointed to key posts are capable, upright, and will uphold our system of government. Appointments are a key thing in our Civil Service. You want to make sure that you appoint good men, you want to make sure you do not waste your money and that is why the President is there holding the second key. We need to make doubly sure that everything works.
The President who safeguards reserves and appointments must have the right experience to decide whether the Government’s budgets and spending proposals are sound and justified. The President has to judge the character, motivation, integrity, ability of the names put up and know what advice to seek and accept.
But the President, doing that, needs to have a mandate because without a mandate, he is unable to operate the system. He has to have the experience, he has to have the judgment. He has to be able to say this is right, that is wrong, this is wise to do, that one, I think we better think over. The President who does that must have experience, must have ability, must have the right judgment to know whether the Government is telling him to do the right thing or not, to judge the Government’s proposals, to judge the character of the people who are being put up. And, therefore, you must have qualifying criteria put down in the Constitution, to know who is qualified to be President. And the qualifying criteria are quite clear – either you hold a senior appointment in the public service: Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, Chief Justice or you have had a senior private sector job running large, complex companies – Singtel, DBS, Keppel, for example. In the Constitution, these are companies with paid-up capital of $100 million.
But this $100 million was set 25 years ago. It is out of date – 25 years from then, we need to look at the number again. Look at what the President is protecting. I will share with you some numbers. When the system started in 1990, and what we are today in 2015. Our GDP in 1990 was $71 billion. Today, it is $402 billion, gone up nearly six times. Our CPF balances in 1990, was $41 billion. Today, CPF members have $300 billion of balances. Our Official Foreign Reserves has gone up from $48 billion to $351 billion, gone up seven times. Temasek Holdings, how much do you think it is worth? Net Portfolio value, $9 billion before, $266 billion now. So, the President’s job, protecting money, protecting reserves, those reserves have gone up, the weight of the job has increased. And the benchmark companies – if you want to do that job – you must be the likes of Singtel, DBS, Keppel. Those companies have also grown. But $100 million is the wrong number today. It is too small for a company to be considered, even in the same kind of responsibility as the President is doing here. In 1993, there were 158 such companies. Today, there are 2,000, but there are not 2,000 such companies which are comparable to the responsibility. So, we have got to update this benchmark, bring it up to date.
The President makes difficult decisions. He is not just checking numbers or adding up accounts, making sure that the accounts are properly presented. He is making economic and policy judgments. If the Government says that the Budget has got a surplus, does the President believe the Government? He has to decide – is the Government making the right judgment? If the Government says, “I want to draw money from the reserve to spend for something”, is it wise, is it justified? If a person is being proposed for a job, is he the right person? Is he suited to the responsibilities? These are real and difficult choices. The President has to make them right.
I give you one example. During the Global Financial Crisis, the world economy was crashing. The financial system was freezing up. Our economy was plummeting, jobs and businesses were at very serious risk. I went to Mr S R Nathan – he was then the President – I explained to him. I asked him for permission to draw from the reserves. How much? A lot of money. For jobs, to save businesses and jobs through Jobs Credit, $5 billion. Then we needed money to guarantee bank deposits in Singapore, a lot of bank deposits, $150 billion standing there. You may not need it, but you may need it to keep confidence in the system. We were not certain whether the plans would work, whether they would be sufficient. The President had to judge whether the Government had got it right, whether our recommendations were sound. So, we briefed him, we briefed his advisers, the CPA. They listened carefully, they thought it over, and they consulted. Eventually, Mr Nathan said “yes”, he gave us permission. We went ahead. We implemented the plans, turned out we did the right thing. Because of the intervention, the outlook changed, we bounced back quickly, and our jobs were safe. We even made good the reserves. In fact, we came through so smoothly, some people even did not notice we had a crisis.
So, it is here that the President makes critical decisions and it is here that we need the President to be competent, to be on top of the job, to be capable and that is why we need the most qualified person.
Minority
The third thing we need to do with the President is to safeguard, to make sure that from time to time we have a minority – a Malay, or an Indian, or an Eurasian, or a non-Chinese – to become the President, because this is a multi-racial society, and we became Singapore because of this fundamental reason. As Mr Lee Kuan Yew said right at the beginning, “This is not a Malay nation, not a Chinese nation, not an Indian nation. Everybody will have a place in Singapore”. The President is the Head of State, he symbolises our nation. Every Singaporean has to identify with him, everybody must know that somebody of my race has a chance to be President, and, in fact, from time to time, does become President – Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian, or any other race.
Over 50 years, we have made a lot of progress becoming one people, regardless of race, language and religion. We had a poll recently done by CNA and IPS. It showed strong support for meritocracy. Most people believe that race does not influence success; that the interests of one’s own race should not come before the interests of other races. And everybody believes this. Even the Chinese believe that Chinese should not come before others. It is the result of a lot of work over the years. We brought people together, we acknowledged our diversity. We did not pretend that race and religion doesn’t matter and we worked against the natural flow to expand our common space.
[Prepared text]
We use English as our common working language. We mixed all races together in HDB estates, so that there are no enclaves or ghettos. We implemented the Ethnic Integration Policy to prevent HDB estates from becoming re-segregated and recite the Pledge in schools every day. We also came down hard on chauvinists who try to play up racial sentiments.
Notwithstanding the progress, we are not a homogeneous society. When it comes to personal choices for example whom you marry, whom your best friends are, who your business partners are – race still matters. The same CNA and IPS survey asked respondents, “Would you accept a particular race marrying into your family?” [To elaborate on slide] Thus it is not surprising that in elections, race is still a factor and other things being equal, a minority candidate is at a disadvantage.
It is the same in other multi-racial societies. In choosing the Head of State, they often consciously arrange for minorities to be appointed or elected, so that minorities feel assured of their place. Canada, an English speaking country with a large French minority, 22 percent, alternates between an English and a French speaking Governor General. New Zealand, with Asian immigrants and a Maori indigenous population, regularly appoints a non-White Governor General. The current one LTG Jerry Mateparae is a distinguished Maori, former Chief of Defence Force. His predecessor, Sir Anand Satyanand, was ethnic Indian. Switzerland has three main ethnic groups (German, French, and Italian). Swiss Germans make up two-thirds of the population. If the Swiss held elections for President, the Swiss Germans would tend to win. Instead Switzerland has a Federal Council with seven members. By an unwritten understanding, the Council includes representatives from the minority ethnic groups. The Presidency rotates annually among the Federal Council members. In all these countries, nobody questions the fitness of the Head of State, just because there is an arrangement or special effort to find one belonging to the minority group
In the US, the President is the Head of State, and is elected every four year. The US ideal is a melting pot – many immigrant races becoming one American people. It should make no difference whether a black or a white becomes President. Yet when President Obama was elected in 2008 it was a huge thing, especially for Black Americans. After 42 White Presidents, and 143 years after the Civil War, a black man finally made it into the White House. As Michelle Obama said, “a house built by slaves”. People said Obama’s election showed that the world had changed, race didn’t matter anymore in US elections. This is completely wrong. Overall, Obama won 53 percent of the votes in 2008 against John McCain. But break down these votes by race, and you will find race mattered hugely. Whites – 43 percent, a minority voted for Obama and Hispanics 67 percent. Blacks voted overwhelmingly for Mr Obama – 95 percent.
In Singapore too, if we ask Singaporeans what race would you like your President to be. Each race prefers their own to be President! Most Singaporeans will accept a President of a different race, but not all. Seen in perspective, we have made great progress in becoming one people. Also glad that younger Singaporeans are more willing to accept a President of a different race than older Singaporeans. But still in an election for President, race does matter, and will matter for a long time to come.
When we created the elected President, we knew this would be an issue, but we had to address a more pressing issue then – finding suitable candidates to stand. We did not have multiple candidates contesting a hot election, putting a good minority candidate at a disadvantage. So we decided not to make any special arrangements for minorities, and instead watch carefully how things worked out.
Over the last 25 years, we were fortunate to have had one minority elected President, Mr SR Nathan, who served with distinction for two terms. Loved by many Singaporeans, of all races. However, he was elected unopposed, both times. Today, the environment has changed. Elections are hotly contested. It will be harder for a minority candidate, however capable or qualified, to win.
Before Presidents were elected, when Parliament chose the President, we had Presidents from all races – Encik Yusof Ishak, Dr Benjamin Sheares, Mr Devan Nair, and Mr Wee Kim Wee. Yusof Ishak was our very first President, and so far our only Malay President. If the next several Presidents are also not Malay, after some time Malay Singaporeans will start to feel uneasy, and understandably so. Likewise with Indian Singaporeans, if we do not have an Indian President for a long time after Mr Nathan. Minorities will ask: Do we have a place in Singapore? Are we truly equal? The Chinese majority may become less sensitive to the needs of other races. We will weaken the sense of shared nationhood, not just among the minorities, but for all Singaporeans. We have to do something about the problem well before that.
This problem is not easy to solve. Meritocracy and equal treatment are fundamental ideals of our society. They have become part of our basic mindset, including among the minorities. Some people fear that if we make an explicit arrangement to ensure a minority President from time to time, it will compromise the principle of meritocracy. The non-Chinese do not want it to appear that we have lowered standards for the sake of having a minority President.
This makes it a delicate problem. Legally it is hard to draft and politically sensitive to explain. Psychologically it takes time to accept.
But it is a real problem, and we have to solve it. We must ensure that minorities get elected as President from time to time. We can and will make sure that all candidates for President, including minority candidates, fully meet the qualifying criteria with no compromise. Then it will be clear that when we do have a minority President, he will be as fully qualified as any other President.
This is not the first time we have introduced special provisions for minorities in our constitution. We did so with GRCs. When the idea was first floated, the minority communities had misgivings. That they did not need it, that it would be patronising and that they were quite happy with the status quo. But now after 30 years, people have come to accept GRCs. GRCs have become an important stabiliser in our system, ensuring that there will always be minority MPs in Parliament, whatever the election outcome. GRCs have also pushed politics towards the centre, favouring multi-racial parties and multi-racial policies, because all parties have to field multi-racial teams and win votes from all races.
Similarly, we need a mechanism to make sure that from time to time, we have a minority President. The Constitutional Commission has proposed a mechanism. Tonight, I am focussing only on the principle. Not how to do it, but why we need this. We want a minority Singaporean regularly to become President, to represent what we feel about Singapore, and our ideal of a multi-racial society. To follow through at the apex of our system – the Head of State – all the things we are doing in schools, in workplaces, through SG-Secure, to strengthen racial harmony. So that a generation from now Singaporeans of all races will feel even closer to one another.
But remember, no matter how carefully we design the elected President system, or our whole political system, there is no absolutely fool proof safety net. We will still always be on a high wire. Our politics can still go wrong. People may be elected who look good, but turn out to be unworthy. Voters may be misled to make unwise decisions through sweet talk and empty promises. Many new countries like us, and even old countries, have gone wrong.
We have been very lucky in Singapore for the last 50 years. First, very lucky that we had Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team. The people supported him, gave them a long run to set us on the right path. Second, very lucky that Mr Lee and his team were able to self-renew, stay abreast of changes, and keep people’s support beyond the first few years, without going wrong or corrupt in office, unlike so many founding leaders of other newly independent countries. Third, even more remarkable that after Mr Lee stepped down as PM, we went through two leadership transitions. Now beyond Mr Lee’s lifetime, the system is still stable, still functioning, and we continue to progress with a new generation born into a very different Singapore, with very different expectations and aspirations, yet understanding what is at stake, working closely with Government and supporting policies which will make Singapore succeed for them.
We count our blessings, but we must do our best to make sure that our political system keeps on working properly for Singaporeans. How?

   singaporewebsite update april",12215,"In his National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore addressed several key areas of national concern and development. He emphasized the importance of adapting to global disruptions, particularly highlighting the impact of technological advancements like Uber and Grab on traditional industries such as taxi services. PM Lee stressed the need for regulatory updates to ensure fair competition and support for incumbents in adapting to these changes.

PM Lee also discussed the broader economic challenges facing Singapore, including the need for continuous innovation and skills development in response to a rapidly changing global landscape. He outlined the roles of various government agencies like the Economic Development Board (EDB) and SPRING in supporting industries and SMEs through these transitions.

A significant portion of his speech was dedicated to the importance of maintaining a multiracial and inclusive society, with specific reference to the elected presidency. He proposed changes to ensure that minorities have opportunities to be elected as President, reflecting Singapore's multicultural identity.

On the international front, PM Lee highlighted Singapore's strategic diplomatic efforts, particularly with major powers like the US and China, and its role in regional stability, especially concerning issues like the South China Sea disputes.

Lastly, PM Lee addressed the internal political landscape, advocating for good governance and the need for a political system that unites rather than divides, ensuring Singapore's continued stability and prosperity. He announced plans to review the elected presidency to ensure it continues to meet the nation's needs, including potentially revising eligibility criteria and ensuring minority representation.

Overall, PM Lee's speech underscored the need for resilience and adaptability in both domestic and international spheres to secure Singapore's future."
2017,"
Good evening again. My fellow Singaporeans, we have had an eventful year. We have been busy guarding against terrorism and strengthening our racial harmony, making friends and cooperating with other countries big and small.
Last year, I spoke about our economy: how we were working to develop skills, build capabilities, promote entrepreneurship, and take the economy to the next level and I am happy to report good progress. We expect growth around 2.5 per cent this year, higher than last year. Wages have been rising, gradually but steadily, and most encouragingly, productivity is improving. Last year, productivity went up by one per cent, after several years of almost zero growth. This year, we should do even better. This is important because productivity is the key to our prosperity, and to higher wages.
We still have work to do. Heng Swee Keat and the Future Economy Council are hard at it. Unions and employers are fully on board. And together, we are implementing Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), industry by industry. We are also pressing on with SkillsFuture, preparing everyone for the jobs of the future, helping workers and professionals with the problems of today when they are displaced from their jobs, retraining and reskilling them to take up new jobs. If we can keep up this path, we can create better jobs and new opportunities for our workers and businesses.
The immediate priorities are important and we will continue to focus on them but tonight I want to take a step back from these immediate priorities. Instead, I would like to discuss three longer term issues that are important to the success and wellbeing of Singapore, for the current generation and also for future generations.
One, building up our preschools so that every child, regardless of his family background, starts well and has a bright future. Two, fighting diabetes, because many Singaporeans suffer from it, not only the old, but increasingly younger people too, and three, making Singapore a Smart Nation, by using IT to the full, to create jobs and opportunities for all Singaporeans.
Preschool, Diabetes, and Smart Nation – these are the things we must do now, work on now, to build our future so that Singaporeans can start right, stay healthy and live smart at every age.
Let me start with preschool. Here, we are talking about infants to six year olds. Nowadays even two month old babies are enrolled in infant care, and that is part of preschool. Preschool is important to give our children a good start and the best chance to succeed in life. In the past, we started at Primary 1, when the child is seven. But now we know we have to begin much earlier, not to give children a head-start in Primary 1, but to build sound foundations for them for life. At an early age, there are specific windows in a child’s development and you must catch that window or you miss it.
For example, a child picks up language skills most easily and rapidly in his first three years. You miss that and it becomes much harder later on. In fact, it is best if they hear the language sounds as infants, before they are eight months old. Social and emotional skills need to be learnt early too: how to play with other children, how to be patient and wait your turn, how to behave when you do not get what you want.
Cognitively, young children need stimulation. Parents and teachers need to encourage kids to talk, not to tell them to keep quiet. Kids are naturally curious. Encourage them to wonder about the world around them, to ask questions, to explore, to express themselves. Of course, parents and family members are the first and best teachers for children, because they look after them, play with them, and talk to them most intensively. But a good preschool will help parents to make the most of these formative windows of a child’s development.
Preschool is also a great practical help to working couples because nowadays, both parents are likely to be working. Not all grandparents are available to become babysitters! They like to play with their grandchildren; they do not want to be responsible for their grandchildren.
Hence, five years ago, the Government moved decisively, to build up preschools, and transform the whole sector. We created almost 50,000 more childcare and kindergarten places, especially in young estates like Punggol and Sengkang. We increased subsidies to make preschools more affordable. We raised the standards of Anchor Operators. PCF Kindergartens have become Sparkletots, with better curriculum, and better trained teachers. NTUC’s My First Skool has also developed engaging programmes. Last month, I visited My First Skool’s campus in Punggol, built on top of a multi-storey carpark. It has an arts programme, coordinated by the National Arts Council. Artists visit the kindergarten to work with the kids and the kids were enjoying all sorts of art – painting, making things, doodling with coloured chalk on a blackboard. I joined them, some of them were doing better than me because I did not do art when I was in kindergarten.
The Ministry of Education (MOE) has also started to run MOE Kindergartens, for children of ages five and six. They have developed a good curriculum. They have hired well-trained teachers, including mother tongue teachers – Malay, Chinese and Tamil. There are now 15 of these MOE Kindergartens. I visited one in Punggol. The kids are happy, and so their parents are happy too.
Every preschool a good preschool. As you can see, we have made good progress and a big reason is that we set up the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). It oversees the whole sector. It brings together all the ministries involved with preschool. It works with the operators to make sure everything goes well.
Now to take the preschools to the next level, we will roll out three more initiatives. First, we will create more places. As I said earlier, in the last five years, we have already created 50,000 more preschool places. But in the young towns, we are still short. In the next five years, we will create an additional 40,000 new places. This will bring the total number of preschool places to about 200,000, which will be almost double what we had.
Here is one centre, coming up in Sengkang West. The shortage of preschool places is mainly for the younger ones, ages zero to four, and those early years are critical for the child’s development. So Anchor Operators will create more places just for this group. For a start, they will build Early Years Centres in new HDB developments. We will call them Early Years Centres for zero to four. Each Early Years Centre will partner a nearby MOE Kindergarten. From zero to four, your child can go to an Early Years Centre and when he reaches five and six, he or she will have a place reserved in that MOE Kindergarten, if you want to take it up.
Second, we will improve the quality of preschool education for ages five and six, in other words the K1s and the K2s. We have enough places already for this group. Now, we want to raise their standards further and MOE will lead the way. MOE’s 15 Kindergartens have helped to establish a good standard at a reasonable price and parents know they can trust the MOE brand. MOE will scale up to 50 kindergartens over the next five years. And this way, MOE can make a bigger impact beyond its own MOE Kindergartens to influence and uplift the quality of the whole sector.
We want every child to go to a good preschool so that all children, regardless of family background, have the best possible start in life.PM Lee Hsien Loong

PM Lee Hsien Loong
Thirdly, we will upgrade the preschool profession in order to attract good teachers and carers because teachers and carers make all the difference to our children. As a comparison, let us look at what we do with MOE teachers for primary, secondary and junior college. We train our teachers well. We have a National Institute of Education (NIE). Trainee teachers attend NIE programmes before they can start teaching. NIE does research and keeps up-to-date on the latest teaching methods. During their careers, periodically teachers return to NIE to upgrade themselves, and prepare for more senior roles. The MOE teachers do fulfilling work; they are paid competitively and they have good career paths. You can be a master teacher – showing other teachers how to teach. You can be a subject specialist – developing new curricula. Or you can be a school leader – like a Vice-Principal, or a Principal, or a Cluster Superintendent. Because teachers are trained well, paid well and have good career prospects, good people take up teaching and we have a good education system.
We will take the same approach with preschool teachers: train them well, reward them well, and attract good, passionate people. I am glad that since we started upgrading and expanding preschools, people have been switching careers, like Ms Marie Luo. I met Marie when I visited the MOE Kindergarten at Punggol View. Marie used to work at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), overseeing productivity. But Marie loved to take care of young children, so when MOE Kindergartens started up, she gave it a try. She has been teaching for more than a year, and can look forward to a good career.
To encourage more people like Marie to join the preschool sector, we will raise the standing of the profession. We will set up a new institute to train teachers well. Today, there is no centralised institute for early childhood development. Instead we have many different preschool training programmes – in Temasek Polytechnic, in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, ITE and the SEED Institute. We will now bring all these different programmes together, under a new centralised institute and we will call it the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC).
The NIEC will be like NIE but it will be for preschool teachers and carers. It will provide the full range of diploma and certificate programmes for preschool professionals. It will also have the scale to develop curricula, with different specialisations, like music, art, mother tongue or special education. Within a larger fraternity, the faculty will have more opportunities for professional development and progression.
We will provide training awards for students of the new institute. The awards will cover fees plus an allowance, so preschool teachers can make a strong start to their careers. We will also work with employers to ensure good career prospects and competitive pay. Over the last five years, as preschools expanded and upgraded, salaries have gone up. As we upgrade the profession, salaries need to improve further. And in particular, salaries must match career progression. Salaries have to be competitive not just for teachers, but also for the more senior specialists, supervisors and principals. Then you will have a career which is attractive, then good people will join. This will take a while but we must do it and we must get there. Only then can we upgrade the preschool sector and get good people to join and make it a career. Only then we can build a strong preschool system. So if you are passionate about kids, I hope you will consider this as a career.
In summary, we are doing three things to build up preschools and give young children a good start: More places for zero to four, better quality for five to six, raising the standing of teachers and carers. These changes will benefit all preschool kids. In addition, we are making a special effort for kids from low income and vulnerable families. These kids need more support, starting even earlier.
We have a programme for them: it is called KidSTART, which we piloted last year. Tan Chuan-Jin started this and is taking a close personal interest in it. Currently 400 families are on KidSTART. The mother gets onto the programme when she is expecting - ideally, in the first trimester. Even before the baby is born, trained officers visit the families at home, to support the expecting mother and impart practical skills and knowledge on health, nutrition and child development. After the baby arrives, the officers continue to coach the parents and they carry on doing so all the way through preschool. The early feedback on KidSTART has been promising. Parents say that their children are more talkative and expressive, and interact much better. And if these results are confirmed, we will scale up KidSTART to benefit more children.
I have described what we are doing to develop our children in practical ways but actually, we are emphasising preschools to achieve a broader social purpose because access to affordable, quality preschools will help level the playing field for young children. Today, every child goes to a good school. We want every child to go to a good preschool so that all children, regardless of family background, have the best possible start in life. We must do this because every child counts and if we get this right, we will foster social mobility and sustain a fair and just society. So it is a practical thing that we are doing but it is a strategic goal which we are aiming for.
And you heard or read ESM Goh at his National Day Dinner last night talking about this – social mobility – how important it is to make sure that we help all the kids, particularly those who do not have an advantaged background, to have a good start in life, not to be at a disadvantage, to be able to have equal opportunities just like everybody else. And we have to start early with KidSTART. We are starting before the baby is born, with preschools. And that is a strategic objective, and that is why I am talking about this subject at tonight’s National Day Rally.
That is also why the Government is investing heavily in young children. We have doubled our annual spending on preschools in the last five years. In 2012, we have spent S$360 million. In 2017, this year we are spending S$840 million. So it is actually more than double. And in the next five years, we will double spending again. So by 2022, five years from now, we will be spending S$1,700 million. It is a heavy investment but worthwhile and necessary.
But all this will be for nought unless young couples do your part. Please have more babies! The champions are Sengkang West families. Sengkang West’s Lam Pin Min told me very proudly he is the advisor with the most babies in his ward – 1,300 last year. PA organises “Embracing PArenthood” events for young parents and babies. Sengkang West has so many babies that Lam Pin Min had to organise multiple “Embracing PArenthood” events. I did just one. So here are some of his pictures - the first group, a second group, a third group, and the fourth. I think the only person who appears in more than one picture is Lam Pin Min. I assure you all the babies are different. So please go forth and do likewise!
My second topic tonight is our health, and specifically diabetes. You may not think diabetes is a major problem, but in fact, it is very serious in Singapore, particularly so for older people but increasingly for younger Singaporeans. Generally, Singaporeans think of ourselves as being fairly healthy. After all, we live quite long but it is not just about how many years you live, the quality of life matters greatly.
Let us take a close look with a live poll. You have got your Pigeonholes all set up. I would like to ask you two questions. If you are in the live audience tonight, please take out your phones and look at them and answer the questions. Are you ready? Let us begin. Question one – what is the life expectancy of Singaporeans? What do you think? Is it 80 years old, 82 years old or 84 years old? Make a guess.
Well, most of you think it is 84. In fact, it is 82 but for women it is 84; for men it is 80. But at 82 years, it is among one of the longest in the world. But this is life expectancy and life expectancy includes both periods of good health and ill health. And you know from your own experience with ageing parents that when people grow old, they suffer from many ailments and frailties, often dragging on for years.
Let me ask question two – on average, how many years of ill health do Singaporeans have in old age? What do you think? Four years, six years, eight years? I think most of you got it right. The answer is actually eight years – a bit shorter for men, a bit longer for women, but on average eight years. On average, we live to 82 years and out of these 82 years in old age, we experience eight years of ill health. Eight years is a long time to be in ill health. It is tough on the old folks, and on their families too, particularly the caregivers.
What causes this ill health? One big reason is diabetes. And unfortunately, here compared to other developed countries, Singapore is almost world champion – just behind the US. Overall, one in nine Singaporeans have diabetes. But the prevalence increases as you age. If you are my age, over 60, three in ten Singaporeans have diabetes. And since most Singaporeans will reach 60, that is a lot of us. In fact, if you look at yourself, and at the person sitting to your left, person sitting to your right, most probably at least one of you will have diabetes one day!
If you break it down by race, among the Chinese, 2.5 in 10 have diabetes; among the Malays, five in 10 have diabetes; and among the Indians, six in 10 have diabetes. These people age 60 and above. Half of Malays in my age group will have diabetes, and more than half of Indian in my age group will have diabetes, already have diabetes. This is a very serious problem, and especially for the Malays and Indians, is actually a health crisis. It is not an exaggeration.
The challenge with diabetes is that in the early stages, it is an invisible disease. You do not feel sick; there are hardly any symptoms. You may not even know that you have it. But if it is not treated, over time it can become very serious. If you look at the top causes of death in Singapore, diabetes does not appear there but actually, many common causes of death can be traced back to diabetes – heart attack, stroke, kidney failure – underlying causes, pre-disposing them to diabetes because diabetes damages all these organs. You may also lose your limbs, or go blind, and for the men, if nothing else worries you, diabetes can make you impotent! And that should cause you to sit up. So what can we do?
Typically, people will immediately ask: what is the Government doing? But with diabetes, the more important question is: What can I myself do, to change my lifestyle and diet, to minimise my risk? Personal choice and responsibility make all the difference to whether we get diabetes or not, and if we already have diabetes, whether we keep it under control. So what can each one of us do?
Let me offer four suggestions. First, please get regular medical check-ups. Find out whether you have diabetes or are at risk. Do not take the attitude that it is better not to know. You must want to know, because if you know your condition, then you can do something about it. Take advantage of the health checks at community events or MOH’s subsidised screenings under Screen for Life programme and do not stop there.
Health checks only tell you how healthy or unhealthy you are. They do not cure your illness, or make you healthier, unless you do something with the results. So if your health check shows something is amiss, please see a doctor. Take the medicine that he prescribes. Follow his advice and surely, he will ask you to exercise more, which is also my second suggestion: please exercise more.
Exercise is good for you. It helps with your blood sugar, you blood pressure. It brings down your weight. It makes you feel better. But if you prefer something more fun, join a group activity. PA organises all sorts of activities every weekend – Zumba, line dancing, brisk walking, taiji. Sign up to enjoy yourself with family and friends, and keep fit and healthy at the same time.
The easiest way to get more exercise is just to walk a little bit more every day. The doctor says to aim for 10,000 steps a day. But I know myself that 10,000 steps is not so easy to hit. I brisk walk for 40 minutes every morning. I walked this morning and today I checked and I am still only at 7,000 steps. The reason is because the rest of the day, I am sedentary – sitting down at the computer, either at work or at home. And many Singaporeans are like me. Only when I have community events or walkabouts, or go on jalan jalan in the evenings, then I reach the target. But let us all make an effort to walk a bit more and work it into your daily routine. For example, walk to the MRT station, rather than take the feeder bus. Some people get off the train one stop early and walk the rest of the way home, or climb the stairs instead of taking the lift. I do that: when I go to the office every morning, I climb up the stairs, and if I go out and come back I climb up the stairs again. Coming down I take the lift. Let us do it together.
To motivate you, the Health Promotion Board is giving everybody in the audience today a free gift. It is a step tracker; I am wearing one. I am taking part in the 520 Million Step Challenge. Please collect yours on your way out and start walking tonight.
My third piece of advice is to eat less and eat healthily. I was looking at some of my old school photos recently. And it reminded me that when I was in school, the children were not as tall, and some of us were quite scrawny. Perhaps we were not eating enough and were a little bit under-nourished. So there were school milk programmes to top up our nutrition. Today, nutrition has improved and our children are taller and better built. Some are too well-built! I cannot show you a photograph, you know what I mean. And already among 5-year olds, one in 10 are overweight. And unfortunately, often baby fat does not go away, but carries into adulthood.
One reason we are putting on weight is because we are eating more. 20 years ago, we ate on average 2,100 calories every day, which is about the right amount if you are not in a very active physical life. This is 1998. Six years later, by 2004, it had gone up to 2,400 calories – that is 300 calories more and that is equivalent to two extra scoops of ice cream every day. By 2010, six years later, it had gone up to 2,600 calories – in other words, another 200 calories, which means another extra scoop of ice cream, plus topping!
I have not done the latest survey yet – one should be coming in this year but I fear the trend is still up. Now, to burn off these extra 500 calories, these three extra scoops of ice cream, you need to run more than an hour every day! How many of you run more than one hour every day? Most of us do not, so obesity has gone up. The key is to be disciplined, and to make the right choices in food.
Start today, so that we can live healthily and live well.PM Lee Hsien Loong
Start today, so that we can live healthily and live well.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
Mr Lee Kuan Yew was very disciplined about his food intake. Charles Chong told me a story: Mr Lee once invited him to lunch. He was the only guest. When the main course was served, the plate came up, he looked at the plate, one and a half pieces of steak – one small steak and one half, tiny piece, one and a half portions for two people. Charles Chong was the guest, so he was served first. He did not know what to do. So out of respect for Mr Lee, he took the tiny, half piece. Mr Lee stopped him. He said, “That is my piece. You take the other one!” So like Mr Lee, we all can decide to eat less, and watch our weight.
Unfortunately, not all of us do that. In fact, we are not just eating more, we are also eating less healthily. Lifestyles have changed. In the past, fewer wives worked. They could prepare healthy, home-cooked meals. Now, increasingly both the husband and the wife work. So families eat out more often. They buy char kway teow or roti prata at hawker centres, or increasingly fast food. But actually, even if you eat out, you can still choose healthier dishes like yong tau foo, sliced fish soup or soto ayam. There are such choices. More hawkers serve healthy alternatives – less oil, less sugar, less salt, but tasting almost as good. In fact, if you get used to it, tasting better, give it a try!
If you do cook at home, make small changes, like replacing white rice with brown or mixed grain rice. I know many of us are used to eating white rice but white rice is bad for diabetes because it has very high glycaemic index (GI), which means white rice may not taste sweet. But the effect of eating white rice is almost like eating sugar and when you eat white rice, your blood sugar will shoot up. If you have always eaten white rice, brown rice may take some getting used to.
Every week, my Ministers and I meet over lunch before our Cabinet meeting. We call it our PreCab Lunch. Some years ago when Khaw Boon Wan was Minister for Health, he suggested to me that we switch to brown rice because it is healthier. So I polled the Ministers for their views; everyone agreed. At least nobody objected. Ever since, I have been serving brown rice at PreCab lunches. But only very, very recently, I found out that some Ministers do not like brown rice. So when we come to PreCab Lunch, they do not have rice and they go home and they eat white rice for dinner! Now I will need another very serious Cabinet discussion to decide what we should serve at PreCab lunch.
As a compromise, I am thinking of trying white rice mixed together with brown rice. It is not quite as healthy but it is better tasting than all brown rice and it is healthier than all-white rice. So at the reception later, I am going to get you to try first. I am serving mixed grain fried rice – white and brown mixed together! Let me know what you think, and if you like it, please tell my Ministers.
I told Seah Kian Peng about our plans and he said that NTUC FairPrice will help me to encourage Singaporeans to eat more brown rice and healthy food. From tomorrow till the end of August, FairPrice will have special discounts and offers on healthy food, including brown rice, so do not hesitate. Let us start eating healthier today!
My fourth piece of advice is to cut down on soft drinks. Soft drinks contain a lot of refined sugar, which is very bad for you. Just one can of soft drink can contain eight cubes of sugar and that is more than you need for one whole day. If you drink soft drinks every day, you are overloading your system with sugar, and significantly increasing your risk of diabetes.
Our children are most at risk because soft drinks are part of their lifestyle. When a young man takes his girlfriend to the cinema, how can they not buy popcorn and soft drinks! And we are seeing more diabetes cases among young people, Type 2 Diabetes, including children, and that means big trouble for their health.
That is why in our schools, tuckshops can only sell drinks containing six per cent or less of sugar. But that does not really solve the problem because the kids then just go outside the school compound and buy the full-strength sweetened drinks at the convenience store.
We are scouting around for solutions. Some countries – several European ones, Mexico, Brunei – they have tried a sugar tax. UK and Chile also placed warning labels on drinks with high sugar content. But it is not clear yet if these measures work. Others have tried to limit the size of soft drinks – no more Big Gulp. But not sure that will work either because people may just buy two smaller gulps instead. Nobody has found an ideal solution yet but we are scanning the horizon and if someone comes up with one that works, we will study it and we will implement it. Meanwhile, we must do something about this problem of soft drinks and sugar.
As a first step, we have got the soft drink producers to agree to reduce the sugar in all their soft drinks sold in Singapore. This will help. But ultimately, what to drink is a personal choice. The best is to drink plain water. Better still, drink PUB water.
I just described four simple things each one of us can do: get a check-up, exercise more, watch your diet, cut down on sugar. It requires commitment, adjustments to our habits, our lifestyles and diet. But the payoff is large and can be done.
I give you an example, Mr Song Hee Pheow, who is a taxi driver. Mr Song got a check-up through a programme started by HPB for taxi drivers – “Check car, Check body”. Send your taxi for servicing. While you wait, send your own body for health screening. Kill two birds with one stone! Mr Song did that and discovered he had diabetes. His health coach told him to change his lifestyle. So he decided to do something about it. Instead of taking the lift to his flat, he climbed the five floors up every day. He also started exercising regularly. He ate less fried food, and cut his sugar intake. In six months, he lost 4kg. And when he saw his doctor at the polyclinic recently, the doctor said – Your blood sugar is good, well done!
If Mr Song can do it, each one of us can do it too. I am sharing this with you hoping that you will take it to heart but actually I am also preaching to myself because I also have to watch my own condition, because I have a family history of diabetes.
My paternal grandmother had diabetes. Several of my uncles had diabetes. My father did not but that is probably because he watched his diet and his weight very carefully and he was extremely disciplined about exercising. And for diabetes, genes play a part but your choices make a difference, and that is why I have to be careful. I do a test for fasting blood sugar twice a year. If the reading is below six, you are okay. If it is above six, well you need to investigate further. So far, I am okay. I am below six but I am not very far below six, so I know I have to be careful. And to stay in the safe zone I weigh myself every day, and I adjust my food intake. I exercise daily. I watch what I eat and drink – wholemeal bread instead of white bread, Teh O Kosong instead of Teh. Teh Gah Dai is completely out of the question. But if the dessert is chendol, it cannot be helped; I will just take a little bit. It takes effort and discipline but it can be done. So I hope you will join me. Start today, so that we can live healthily and live well.
My third topic tonight is a Smart Nation. What is Smart Nation about? Some think it is about each person owning two handphones, or learning to play Pokemon Go, or having the fastest internet connection. Others talk about e-commerce, the Internet of Things, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and big data. Those are all part of it, but not the whole story.
Smart Nation is about Singapore taking full advantage of IT. Using IT comprehensively to create new jobs, new business opportunities, to make our economy more productive, to make our lives more convenient. To make this an outstanding city in which to live, work and play.
We have a natural advantage. We are compact. We are highly connected. Our people are digitally literate. Our schools are teaching students basic computing and robotics. But while we have the right ingredients, we lag behind other cities in several areas. For example, electronic payments.
China has gone the furthest with e-payments. Lim Swee Say told me how he found out about this. He was in Shanghai a few years ago, queuing to buy gao lak, chestnuts, at a roadside hawker. He saw people in front of him waving their handphones before taking their chestnuts and leaving, without paying any cash. So being Singaporean, he thought there must be some special offer. When it came his turn, he confidently said, I do not need the special offer, I will pay the full price in cash! The hawker did not say anything – just gave him a quizzical look and pointed him to the QR code. And that was then he realised the QR code was for WeChat Pay and he was the suaku one!
Indeed, in major Chinese cities, cash has become obsolete. Even debit and credit cards are becoming rare. Everyone is using WeChat Pay or AliPay and these apps are linked to your bank account. To pay someone money, just pick up the phone, scan his QR Code. And you can use these apps for nearly all payments.
You can buy snacks from a roadside stall like Swee Say. You can see the QR code here, there is another one here. You can pay for a taxi ride. You can even tip the waiter at a restaurant. So when visitors from China find that they have to use cash here, they ask: how can Singapore be so backward?
In Singapore, we too have e-payments, but we have too many different schemes and systems that do not talk to one another. So people have to carry multiple cards, and businesses have to install multiple readers. It is inconvenient for consumers, it is costly for businesses. And the result is, most of us still prefer cash and cheques – 6 in 10 transactions are cash and cheques.
We must simplify and integrate our systems. MAS has been working hard at this – integrating the different systems into one – so now at last we have one single unified terminal that can read different cards. MAS and the banks have also rolled out a new service, called PayNow. PayNow links your mobile phone number to your bank account. So you can pay and receive money using your mobile banking app. You can pay money to somebody’s mobile number, if he is on PayNow. And if you are on PayNow, other people can pay you just using your mobile number. So you use your app you send $20, you know his phone number, you send it to him, it pops up on his account. It is done. Different bank, notwithstanding, money goes across. Does not matter if the bank is different. In fact, you do not have to know his bank account number, or which bank he is using.
Soon you will be able to use QR codes too. It is convenient, it is cheap. It is safe. There is no credit card fee. So next time I am at a hawker centre, I look forward to paying for my meal with PayNow. Then I will know it is fully working.

Another area where IT can help is public safety and security. I chair the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council. The Council met recently. The members, some Singaporeans, some international experts. I was struck by what one of the Council members said – that Singapore had a reputation as one of the safest cities in the world, so she was surprised to find that when it came to using IT to make a city safe, other cities were ahead of Singapore. I told her she was quite right.
Many cities already have comprehensive CCTV and sensor networks. And they also can integrate the inputs from all the sources, analyse and make sense of the information, and respond promptly if there is an incident or an emergency. Take for example the Boston Bombings. During the Boston Marathon in April 2013, about four years ago. Terrorists detonated two bombs near the finish line. There were many casualties. The Boston Police pulled together a huge amount of information from CCTVs, social media, license plate readers, plus video and photos contributed by the public. They combed through all this data. Within three days, the police identified the two bombers, and released footage of them. And this prevented the bombers from moving around freely. The police soon tracked them down, killed one, and arrested the other.
In Singapore we started building our own network of sensors, especially CCTV cameras, some time ago. The Police installed CCTVs at HDB void decks and lift landings to deal with loan sharks. And it has worked. We see fewer cases of “owe-money-pay-money” now. They do not paint your door but I just read in the newspapers the “owe-money-pay-money” has gone online now. But at least the physical harassment is down. Residents are greatly relieved.
Other agencies have different sensors. PUB has sensors to detect water levels in drains to know whether it is likely to flood or not. LTA has cameras to monitor traffic conditions and deter illegal parking. The camera is quite small, and the sign is very big. Hotels, shopping centres and office buildings also have their own CCTV systems. But we have not brought all the different systems together.
When the Little India riot happened in December 2013, we were caught a little flat-footed. There were too few CCTV cameras monitoring Little India. We had to rely on footage posted by the public on social media. Since then we have made progress. We are building an integrated national sensor network. We are making “every lamp-post a smart lamp-post”, meaning it can mount different types of sensors on any of the lampposts. We are installing more CCTV cameras in public places. We are combining inputs from different sources – police, LTA, hotels and commercial buildings, even handphones, which are effectively sensors on the ground.
And we are learning to analyse this combined data, for example, using artificial intelligence to automatically flag when something unusual is happening. So if I have 10,000 cameras, I do not need 1,000 people watching those cameras. I just need maybe just 10 people. Each person can watch 1,000 cameras and if the AI detects that something funny is happening, it will pop up and the man can pay attention and a response can be directed. So one day if we have an incident like the Boston Bombings, then the Home Team can assess the situation quickly and respond promptly, or even pre-empt it from happening.
This is a major project. Meanwhile, we are working on smaller projects too, to solve daily problems. Like paying for parking. We have ERP, we have mobile phones, and yet we are still tearing parking coupons, which we have been doing for 40 years. Dozens of other cities have parking apps. Why do we not? So I pushed HDB and URA to go digital. And I am glad that with GovTech’s help, we have now developed an app for street parking – and it is called parking.sg. Actually they should call it “parking lady lai liao”. You only pay for however long you park. If it is 18 minutes, you pay for 18 minutes, and the app will alert you when your session is about to end. If you want to park longer, you can extend your session remotely. No need to rush back to your car to add coupons before the parking lady puts a summons on you. We will launch parking.sg by October. And it will save motorists a lot of unnecessary parking hassles.
These small projects are instructive. They show what can be done. They help us learn and adapt to new technology in our daily lives and they prepare us to make bigger adjustments which are necessary later on.
I give you another example from the retail business. Traditional retail is being transformed by technology. People are shopping online. Delivery services like Redmart, HonestBee and Amazon Prime now have become popular. Online retailers are also setting up brick-and-mortar stores, with a twist. Like in Seattle, Amazon has just opened a drive-up grocery store. You order your items online. You choose a pick-up time, maybe when you are on your way home from work. At your allotted time, you drive to the store to do the pickup. A licence plate reader will register your arrival. Your groceries are brought out to your car. It is not available here yet, but perhaps it is not so far away.
This means retail stores will not disappear. But traditional stores and businesses must adapt and reinvent themselves. Use technology to offer customers more efficient, more convenient service. I am glad to see that our businesses are responding. Supermarkets have had self-service counters for some time now, which are popular with shoppers. FairPrice has taken it further. They have opened an unmanned, cashless Cheers store at Nanyang Polytechnic. There is no cashier in this convenience store, no staff at all. To buy an item, you simply take it off the shelf, you do a self-checkout. There is a back-end system which tracks the inventory and automatically restocks when the stocks run down. It saves manpower and costs for Cheers, offers convenience and savings for customers. I hear Cheers is going to push out another store like this soon.
We have got continue to push such projects. The world is changing. Unless we change with it, we will fall behind. Singapore must always stay with the leaders to attract talent and business, to live up to our own expectations of what we ought to be and can be.
To do such Smart Nation projects, big or small, we need engineers, programmers, data analysts, technicians. We need people with the skills. We need managers with the understanding. We need leaders with the dare and the courage and the organisational ability to make it happen. There is a worldwide shortage of such talent and skills. But we must urgently build up our talent pool. The Government is offering scholarships and sponsorships for engineering. The SkillsFuture and Professional Conversion Programmes will help Singaporeans build up and upgrade their skills. This is one direct way a Smart Nation will create new jobs and opportunities for our people.
When we started out with economic development, we put a lot of emphasis on engineering and science. In fact, when we gave scholarships, almost all the scholarships were for engineering but in the last decade, two decades, the trend has shifted. First it was balanced, from engineering to economics and liberal arts, which was a good sign. Then it went all the way and nowadays most of the students going on scholarship are not doing engineering and sciences. They are doing liberal arts, which are good subjects but I need a balance. We really must encourage our best students, a good proportion of them, to take up engineering, sciences and computer sciences. You come back, there are many things to do where your skills will be very valuable.
Smart Nation is for all of us, young and old. We are making every effort to bring everyone along - through our schools, through SkillsFuture, and through PA. Many Singaporeans are using IT to create jobs or solve social problems. In my Malay speech, I described how Syafiq grew his company, and now Riverwood employs 120 workers. In my Chinese speech, you saw how Gillian Tee’s company, Homage, gave many seniors and their families’ peace of mind, by providing on-demand caregiving services.
If you know about IT, you can share your knowledge with others, to help bring them up to speed, like Mr Tariam Singh. Tariam is 70. He does not look it but he is. He is a volunteer Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassador. He helps fellow seniors learn new IT skills. Here he is in action.[Video plays]
Tariam speaks many languages. He teaches in Hokkien, Mandarin, Malay, and Punjabi. He shows seniors how to use messaging apps and social media, to connect with family and friends. He brings people together to learn, and make friends with one another. And this is how we will become a Smart Nation together – by taking the initiative to improve ourselves; by helping others and bettering all our lives; by looking towards the future and making Singapore a happening place where people want to live.
Tonight, I have spoken about three things we are doing to build our future. Making our preschools better because we want every child to start well and have the best chance in life. Declaring war on diabetes so that we can stay well, live healthily, and enjoy the fruits of our labours. Building a Smart Nation to create opportunities for all of us and keep Singapore a leading city in the world.
Why are we so preoccupied with the future? Whom are we doing this for? Not just for ourselves, but for our children and future generations.
In January, I presented Edusave Awards to residents of Teck Ghee. It was a reward and an encouragement for the students who have done well and a proud moment for their parents who worked hard to support them and who encouraged them to excel.

Every generation striving and building for the next; undaunted by challenges and disruptions, instead working together to overcome every obstacle, seize every opportunity and realise a bright future for all of us.
PM Lee Hsien Loong
One family I met moved me. This is Adam, receiving his Edusave Merit Award. You can see the smile on his face. After the ceremony, I met Adam’s father, Aziz. He showed me an old picture. It was a photo of himself when he was a schoolboy, receiving an SBC House Union Bursary from me – we were both much younger – in 1986! So, I have presented awards to father and son, 31 years apart.
It was a special moment for Aziz, for Adam, also for me. Recently, I met the grandfather, Ahmad. Ahmad was a gardener with SBC, the old Mediacorp. This is Ahmad down here, Aziz and Adam. And that is why Aziz qualified for the Bursary all those years ago!
It is my Government’s duty to build for our future, so that every family can be like Ahmad, Aziz and Adam. It has ever been so, and it must always be so. In the beginning when we had little else, we had faith in our future. We believed every family should have the chance to work hard and do well, and improve their lives. We wanted every generation to outdo their parents. We strove mightily to make this happen.
This family’s story started with Ahmad, who belonged to the pioneer generation. When Aziz was born, he could go to a good school and receive every help to further his education. In 1986, when Aziz received his bursary, Singapore was going through a difficult time. We were just coming out of a severe recession. We had taken drastic measures to revive the economy, including a sharp and painful CPF cut.
But even as we dealt with the crisis, we never stopped building for the future. We continued to improve our schools, expand our polytechnics and universities, and upgrade the old Vocational and Industrial Training Board (VITB) – this is the Ang Mo Kio VITB, just across the road from where we are now – to build today’s ITE.
Aziz could work hard and do well. He graduated with a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic. He became an engineer working for semiconductor multinationals. He upgraded himself along the way and earned a Master’s Degree in Engineering Management. As the new bio-medical sciences industry took off, Aziz was headhunted to be a senior maintenance engineer with GSK, a pharmaceutical multinational.
Now it is his son, Adam’s turn. Adam is growing up in a completely different world. He will need different skills to compete in the future economy. He will have to study and work hard like his father – there is no escaping that. But like his father, he too will have the opportunity to thrive.
Adam is now studying in Teck Ghee Primary School. He and all his TGPS schoolmates will learn how to code and programme, and if they are keen, to do robotics and digital media. We are giving children like Adam strong foundations so that when they start working, they can take up good jobs and seize the opportunities and make this a Smart Nation. Perhaps one day Adam may launch his own startup! Why not?
This is the Singapore of the last half century: Ahmad, a gardener; Aziz, a pharmaceutical engineer; and Adam, a bright future ahead of him. Every generation striving and building for the next; keeping our eyes on tomorrow and investing in our children; undaunted by challenges and disruptions, instead working together to overcome every obstacle, seize every opportunity and realise a bright future for all of us.
Good night!

   singaporewebsite update april",8620,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed several key areas of development and future plans for the nation. He reported positive progress in the economy, with a growth expectation of around 2.5% for the year, an improvement in wages, and a significant rise in productivity, which is crucial for prosperity and higher wages. The Future Economy Council, along with unions and employers, are actively implementing Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) and advancing the SkillsFuture initiative to prepare the workforce for future jobs and address current employment challenges.

A major focus of the speech was on long-term issues critical to Singapore's success. These include enhancing preschool education to ensure every child, regardless of background, gets a good start; combating diabetes, which is increasingly affecting younger populations; and transforming Singapore into a Smart Nation through extensive use of information technology to create jobs and opportunities.

Specifically, the government plans to significantly increase preschool places, improve the quality of preschool education, and elevate the preschool profession to attract quality educators. For diabetes, the emphasis is on personal responsibility in lifestyle choices, regular medical check-ups, and dietary adjustments. In terms of becoming a Smart Nation, PM Lee highlighted initiatives like integrated e-payment systems, enhanced public safety through a national sensor network, and digital solutions for everyday challenges like street parking.

These efforts are part of a broader strategy to ensure that Singapore remains competitive, fosters social mobility, and provides a high quality of life for its citizens, now and in the future."
2018,"
Good evening again. My fellow Singaporeans. We have had a busy year, both at home and internationally
Two months ago, we hosted the first ever meeting between a US President and a DPRK Chairman, Mr Donald Trump and Mr Kim Jong Un. Singapore was just the host; we were not involved in the discussions. Still, we had a big responsibility to ensure that the Summit proceeded smoothly and safely.
Why did the US and the DPRK choose Singapore to host the Summit? I think they considered us a serious and reliable partner. We are friendly and straight with all parties. And both trusted us to have the infrastructure and capability to provide a safe and secure environment. It was a daunting task, but we rose to the challenge. We welcomed our guests with ‘Uniquely Singapore’ touches of warmth and hospitality. You may have seen the Sentosa cannons, barrels decorated with flowers and olive branches. SDC has good staff. We found and assigned Korean-speaking officers to the North Korean delegation. We packed goodie bags for 2,500 international journalists, with thoughtful items like bottled water and a portable fan to beat the heat. We kept the journalists well fed, with meals and snacks from local sponsors. We even had laksa flavoured cookies.
After the Summit, we held appreciation events for the officers who had worked so hard. I attended several of them. Tonight I want to thank the officers and your families once again, personally. You did not just answer the call of duty. You gave your best and more. Many of you worked 24/7. It was Ramadan, and Muslim officers were fasting. Some officers even had to abort leave plans, and cut short family vacations at the last minute. At the Home Team party, I chatted with a Gurkha Contingent officer, who had been on duty outside the St Regis Hotel. He told me how proud he had felt when a woman leaned over the crowd barrier to tell him: “Thank you for keeping Singapore safe.”
I would also like to thank all Singaporeans who made an extra effort to show what Singapore could do. We received postcards from a class of Primary 2 students from Methodist Girls’ Primary School (MGS). The kids had written to thank Singapore for having “lighted the world” by hosting the Summit. They reminded us that “when Singaporeans work together, we can do great things”. I am heartened that even our eight year olds followed the news and knew what we were doing.
Organising the Summit brought us all together, supporting and cheering one another on. We have every reason to feel proud of ourselves. Well done, Team Singapore.
We hope that the Summit has helped to defuse tensions on the Korean Peninsula. But Korea is not the only trouble spot in the world. The world situation has become much more uncertain. Openness, globalisation and free trade, have all come under pressure. The US used to promote free trade, and the free movement of people. But now, many Americans are questioning the benefits of this approach. They feel that other countries are taking advantage of them. Thus, the US has made “rebalancing trade” a top priority, rebalancing country by country, rebalancing item by item. It has unilaterally imposed tariffs on imports from other countries – the EU, Canada and Mexico, and especially China. These countries are retaliating, imposing their own tariffs on US exports like soybeans, bourbon, blue jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. They want to inflict maximum pain on Trump’s supporters, who grow or make these things, hoping to force the US to back off.
This tit-for-tat affects business confidence, undermines the multilateral trading system, and threatens global prosperity. There are no winners in a trade war. Small and open economies are especially vulnerable. And Singapore will suffer collateral damage.
Beyond economics, world peace and security, and stability are at risk. The trade frictions have eroded trust, and sharpened tensions and rivalries between countries. The US and Europeans have long been firm friends and allies, but now, they are arguing fiercely over trade and defence spending. China and the US have the most important bilateral relationship in the world. They are interdependent and they also need to work closely together on global issues like climate change. But the Trump Administration has named China as America’s “strategic competitor” and President Xi Jinping has warned that China will punch back and will not “turn the other cheek”.
This is an unprecedented situation. Henry Kissinger recently told the Financial Times: “We are in a very, very grave period for the world”. We cannot be confident that the major powers will continue to work with one another, and that the existing international system which has held the world together for so long will still hold. We do not know whether after a while new rules and norms for international cooperation will form, or whether there will be prolonged tension and suspicion, mutual rivalries and hostile blocs. We are therefore at a turning point. We hope all countries will act with restraint and wisdom, overcome the current challenges, and find a new way to move forward together.
In an uncertain world, ASEAN is all the more important to us. We have to strengthen ASEAN and work on our relationships with all our ASEAN partners, especially our two closest neighbours, Indonesia and Malaysia.
Indonesia will hold elections next year. They have just decided on the Presidential candidates. They will be preoccupied with election campaigning for the next few months.
I have worked well with President Jokowi. We have wide-ranging and mutually beneficial cooperation with Indonesia. I hope this will continue. In October, President Jokowi will be hosting me to our annual Leaders’ Retreat, this time in Bali. We will be discussing ways to do more together.
Malaysia has just had its General Election. For the first time ever, it has changed its governing coalition, from Barisan Nasional to Pakatan Harapan. Malaysia has a new generation of leaders, a combination of young talent and experienced hands. Of course, Prime Minister Mahathir is not new to us. We have worked with him before, the last time he was PM for 22 years until 2003. That is when this picture was taken, which is why I look with more black hair. We completed several important projects with Malaysia under Dr Mahathir, including the Second Link at Tuas and the Linggiu Dam in Johor. We have worked with some of his coalition partners and Ministers too. Anwar Ibrahim was my counterpart as Dr Mahathir’s Deputy and also Finance Minister. Home Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was the Johor Menteri Besar when we built the Linggiu Dam.
In May, soon after the Malaysian Election, I visited Dr Mahathir in Putrajaya. I also met DPM Wan Azizah and Anwar Ibrahim. I had good meetings with all three of them. I told Dr Mahathir that I wanted to work with him to take our bilateral relationship forward. He agreed that we should, because we are each other’s closest neighbours.
Dr Mahathir and his team are determined to review and change many of the policies set by the previous Malaysian Government. I appreciate their reasons. But some of their reviews affect Singapore’s ongoing projects with Malaysia, including the High Speed Rail (HSR) and the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link to Johor. We entered into these two projects in good faith, after careful negotiations, because they benefitted both countries. Now Malaysia wants to defer the HSR. Khaw Boon Wan has met Azmin Ali, Malaysia’s Economic Affairs Minister, to understand Malaysia’s intentions, and to find a constructive way forward. Both the HSR and the RTS Link have legally binding Bilateral Agreements. These set out clearly the duties of each party, and what happens if either party wants to change or to terminate the agreements. Both sides have to carry out what has been agreed to, unless we mutually agree to vary the terms.
Dr Mahathir has also said that he wants to review our 1962 Water Agreement. This is not a new issue. It had come up before, when Dr Mahathir was previously PM. You know Singapore’s view – the Water Agreement is sacrosanct. We must proceed strictly in accordance with its terms. To avoid any misunderstanding, Foreign Minister Vivian recently reiterated our position in Parliament. So that is why I am giving one sentence here. The full statement – look it up on the internet.
We have worked well with Malaysia over the years. We have done substantial projects with successive governments and brought tangible benefits to both Singaporeans and Malaysians. I hope that with Dr Mahathir and his new team, we can build on our deep partnership, look ahead, and make further progress together. Ultimately, the fundamentals of our relationship with Malaysia have not changed. We are closely bound by ties of kinship and history, geography and economics. We need to work together to tackle common challenges. When our interests diverge, we must find constructive ways to resolve our differences. If Singapore-Malaysia relations stay stable and close, we can pursue win-win cooperation and each focus on our own domestic priorities. We have many of them. So do the Malaysians.
Although our external environment has become more uncertain, Singapore’s economy is still growing steadily. Efforts to transform our economy are making progress. Our businesses, including SMEs, have been improving their productivity and expanding both in and outside Singapore. Our workers, supported by unions and employers, are working hard to upgrade their skills, and to seize new job opportunities. We are on the right track. The economic restructuring will lay a strong basis for our future growth.
Earlier in my Chinese speech, I spoke about cost of living pressures – what causes them, what the Government is doing, and how you can stretch your own dollar. I explained how we are helping people cope with water and electricity bills through U-Save rebates. I described our changing lifestyle, how handphones, infant formula, and eating out, among other things, have impacted families, and what you can do to lessen your burden and what the Government is doing.
Beyond these, three major expenditure items – housing, education, and healthcare – affect our cost of living in a big way, at different points in our lives. When young couples buy an HDB flat, it is your first financial commitment. When you start a family and have children, preschool fees can add up. When you grow older, medical bills can be unpredictable and significant, and can be a burden on your family.
Therefore, housing, education and healthcare are three areas that the Government is very focused on. We will spare no effort to ensure you can afford them. I have often spoken about education at National Day Rallies, and last year I spoke quite a bit about preschool education. This year, I will talk about healthcare and housing, starting with healthcare.
Healthcare
Singaporeans are indeed spending more on healthcare. Partly because we have more advanced treatment options and better equipment, more sophisticated equipment. But a bigger reason is because Singaporeans are living longer, and growing older, which means we are likely to have more episodes of illness and more medical problems to treat.
How have we kept healthcare spending affordable for Singaporeans? We have our 3Ms – MediSave, MediShield and MediFund. At the same time, Government provides heavy subsidies – up to 80 percent in our hospitals, and also for primary and long term care. This framework has worked well for many years. It has produced good healthcare outcomes. It has held national healthcare spending low and also kept healthcare affordable for you.
In recent years, we have made further changes to help you with your medical costs. First, we upgraded MediShield to MediShield Life. A big move to protect Singaporeans from unexpected large medical bills – big ones. The payouts are more generous, and there is no lifetime claim limit. You enjoy lifelong protection, even if you have pre-existing conditions or you were previously uninsured. If you suddenly have to go to the  hospital or undergo a major operation, MediShield Life will help you. Last year alone, close to 200,000 Singaporeans benefitted from MediShield Life, and the payouts amounted to over $800 million.
Second, for outpatient expenses, we introduced the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). At GP clinics, your CHAS card entitles you to generous subsidies, especially for the lower income. Dr Lily Neo, who is a GP, told me that after the CHAS was introduced, she saw more elderly patients. She said that our old folks are very resilient and generally put off seeing the doctor until they cannot tahan anymore. But because of CHAS, they now come to her earlier, which is better and she can treat them before their conditions worsen.
CHAS has worked well. As we grow older, more of us will have chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure or cholesterol. But we can continue to live a full life if we manage these conditions – by taking good care of ourselves, eating healthily, taking our medications regularly and following up with our family doctor. I think all of us will appreciate a little bit of help with the regular medical bills for such chronic conditions. Today, CHAS covers middle and lower income Singaporeans. We will now extend CHAS to all Singaporeans with chronic conditions, regardless of income. The benefits will continue to be tiered according to income. MOH will announce the details later on.
For those who visit the polyclinic instead of the GP, I have good news too. MOH has been building and upgrading polyclinics and medical centres across the island. For example, in Punggol and Kampung Admiralty amongst others. Punggol Polyclinic opened last November. It focuses on women’s and children’s health, to cater to the young families living nearby. Admiralty Medical Centre is at Kampung Admiralty, where many elderly residents live, and where I recorded my National Day Message. It provides health education, eye checks and fall-risk screening for the elderly, at their doorstep.
I also recently opened the new Ang Mo Kio polyclinic. It is bigger and better, with more and improved services. Here you see, they have a special dentist chair, so you can put a wheelchair patient in and the wheelchair patient does not have to get up and be manoeuvred onto the dentist chair separately. It is a great help for old people. There is a senior care centre offers day care, rehabilitation and home care services, saving elderly and less mobile residents trips to the hospital. My residents, as you can see, are very happy. In fact, AMK Polyclinic has become so popular that the staff told me they are getting “medical tourists”. Not from overseas, but they come from Yishun, and even Bedok and Jurong. All of you are very welcome to Ang Mo Kio. But actually you do not have to worry, because we are building more polyclinics across Singapore – in Sembawang, Eunos, Kallang and Bukit Panjang by 2020 and then a few years later by 2023, in Nee Soon Central and Tampines North. Some of these are to upgrade and improve existing ones. And we will make sure there are affordable, accessible, high quality primary care all over Singapore
Third, we have improved financial support for long term care. We have seen our own parents or grandparents getting old, growing weaker, gradually becoming unable to take care of themselves. They can no longer feed themselves, dress themselves, or move around independently. They struggle to perform these Activities of Daily Living or you call it ADLs. Activities that when you are young, you take for granted. It is a little bit sad, you see it happen. But that is life. One day it will happen to us. So we have the ElderShield scheme. If you cannot do three of these ADLs, ElderShield pays out a monthly sum of $300 or $400, for up to 6 years. MOH has revamped ElderShield fundamentally, and we will soon have CareShield Life. CareShield Life will pay out significantly more – at least $600 a month and it will pay out for as long as you live, not just six years. The scheme will start in 2020. It will cover all Singaporeans born in 1980 and younger. Even people with an existing disability will be covered. The Government will subsidise the premiums for lower- and middle-income families, so that these families can pay their share out of Medisave. If you are older – born before 1980 – you can also to choose to join CareShield Life. It is not compulsory, but you can join and I hope you will do so. Why? Because you will get a generous subsidy to help pay the premiums. The Government will co-pay, so you are getting a good deal. But really because it will give you and your family more peace of mind. It is something which you probably will need. Gan Kim Yong tells me that this is the most difficult of his healthcare schemes to explain to the public. So he commissioned me to do it for him tonight. Young, healthy people cannot imagine themselves being old and disabled. When you are young, sometimes it feels like you will be young forever, but alas it is not so. If you wait until you are older before thinking about disability insurance, by then the premiums will be higher, and you may no longer even be eligible because you may already have conditions and not be insurable.
Singaporeans are living longer, but unfortunately our additional years are not always healthy years. As many as 1 in 2 of us will, at some point in our lives, no longer be able to perform three ADLs. Just think of the old folks you know, and you will see that this is the reality. This is why I believe CareShield Life can help all of us. It is offered to you. I hope you will take it up.
These are some of the major changes to our healthcare financing over the last few years. We want all Singaporeans to have access to affordable, high quality healthcare. No one should be denied medical care because they cannot afford it and that is my commitment to you.
No one should be denied medical care because they cannot afford it and that is my commitment to you.PM Lee Hsien Loong

We have taken special care of elderly Singaporeans. Four years ago, I launched the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP). The PGP was for the group of Singaporeans born in 1949 or earlier, who came of age when the country was in our early years of development. They were a special generation, who sacrificed much to bring up their families. They did not have good educational opportunities. Most started working early, had low-paying jobs, and could not put aside much for old age. They spent most of their working lives in Third World Singapore; only to retire in First World Singapore. Understandably, they were worried about their healthcare needs. We implemented the PGP to recognise the Pioneer Generation for their sacrifices and to support them in their silver years. So far, we have spent more than $1.3 billion of the $8 billion we set aside for the PGP. 450,000 Pioneers have benefitted – and they fully deserve it.
When we introduced the PGP, we knew that Singaporeans a little younger than the Pioneers who would just miss out. We gave those who were born between 1950 and 1959 annual MediSave top-ups – $100 or $200, depending on their circumstances. Nevertheless, a MediSave top up is not quite the same thing as the PGP. We have not forgotten this group. They lived through the tumultuous years of the 1950s and early 1960s. First came the struggle for independence from the British. Domestically, Singapore politics was fiercely fought, over different visions of the colony’s future. In 1959, Singapore gained internal self-government, one big step towards independence. The PAP won the General Election that year, and formed the Government for the first time. Then came the split with the Communists, Merger with Malaysia, and then Separation and unexpected Independence – alone.
For those born in the 1950s, these were indelible, formative experiences that shaped them for life. They were too young to participate in events but most were old enough to sense the electricity in the air, to share the excitement of the changes, to feel the hope of a brighter tomorrow. They saw the posters and banners that festooned the streets, and were stirred by the rallying cry “Merdeka.” One word that meant so much – liberation, freedom, independence. One word that expressed the determination and the passion, the ambitions and aspirations, of a people who were roused and on the move. And seldom were the people more roused than on 3 June 1959, when Mr Lee Kuan Yew, newly elected Prime Minister, addressed a huge rally at the Padang. As he told the crowd from the City Hall steps: “Once in a long while in the history of a people there comes a moment of great change. Tonight is such a moment in our lives… We begin a new chapter in the history of Singapore.” Most memorable was his call to action, captured in this clip. You have seen it. You have heard it. But it is still electrifying.
This group born in the 1950s are the Merdeka Generation. In Chinese, 立国一代, and in Malay, of course, Generasi Merdeka. There are 500,000 of the Merdeka Generation today. I am proud to be one of them.
Having lived through the battles and upheavals of the Merdeka struggle, and seen how their parents have scraped and slogged for them, when the Merdeka Generation grew up, they understood instinctively what was at stake. They accepted hardships, made sacrifices, answered the call of duty, and worked with their leaders to build a better tomorrow. The men were among the earliest batches called up for National Service. They were the first of the SAF – the Army, Navy and Air Force. Many, especially girls, did not complete their education. They came out to work early, to support the family and younger siblings. Some joined the workforce amidst economic uncertainty and high unemployment, as the British Forces withdrew from Singapore. All started working when wages were still low. Together with the Pioneer Generation, the Merdeka Generation contributed to building Singapore, to making Merdeka – Independence – a success.
Compared to the Pioneer Generation, the Merdeka Generation are better off. They were born later, and benefitted from an extra decade of economic growth. They were generally better educated than the Pioneers, especially the younger ones. The Merdeka Generation earned more over their lifetimes, and accumulated more CPF savings, because in the early 80s, wages increased sharply. CPF rates also went up significantly. But of course, the cohorts that came after them did even better. As we improved the education system, year by year, more of the younger cohorts earned diplomas and degrees, and found higher skilled and better paid jobs. People stopped dropping out of school because they needed to work. They could afford school. They could get the education. They could invest in their children for a lifetime, and therefore, they earned more, and saved more
Most of the Merdeka Generation today are in their 60s. They have either left the workforce, or will soon be retiring. Many have similar healthcare concerns as the Pioneers. They are looking at their CPF savings and MediSave accounts, worried about having enough for their medical needs as they grow older. I think we owe something to them.The Government will work out a “Merdeka Generation Package”. The Merdeka Generation Package will help this group to meet their medical expenses. We will announce the details next year. It will cover similar areas as the PG Package. For example, outpatient subsidies, MediSave top ups, MediShield Life premium subsidies, and payouts for long term care. The benefits will not be as large as for the Pioneer Generation, who had much less advantage in life. But the Merdeka Generation Package will go some way to relieve their healthcare worries. More importantly, it will show our appreciation for the Merdeka Generation and their contributions.
In summary, we are making big changes to our healthcare financing framework. We have strengthened the 3Ms, and introduced MediShield Life. We will soon enhance CHAS and introduce CareShield Life. We implemented the PG Package. We will set aside a significant sum to implement a Merdeka Generation Package. This is not yet the logo but it is a first approximation, courtesy of my very good team from Nanyang Polytechnic. Our schemes are now more comprehensive and inclusive, and Singaporeans can have more peace of mind that their healthcare needs are well taken care of. By the way, if you look carefully at this, you will find this is a yellow CHAS, which is a different colour from the orange ones and maybe there is a hint down there.
Apart from healthcare, many Singaporeans are also concerned about housing. But unlike healthcare, housing is not a simple matter of keeping prices down. Because house prices affect different people differently and the same person differently, at different times. When you want to buy a house, you want prices to be low. When you own a house or want to sell it, you want prices to be high. So, it is not possible to please everybody.
Still, Singapore’s housing policies have been uniquely successful. We are the only major city in the world where nearly every young couple getting married can afford to buy their first home immediately. In other major cities, young couples can only hope to rent a flat, and the monthly rent can cost up to 40% of their household income. And in some cities, you do not rent a flat, you rent a space. Or sometimes a tube, because that is all you can afford. Whereas in Singapore, you buy a flat, you pay for most of your flat out of your CPF, and the flat is yours.
Take Yong Kuang and Sabrina for example. They got married recently, and bought a four room BTO flat in Punggol. They paid a nett price of $345,000 for their four room flat, after HDB housing grants. This was less than five times their annual income. As a rule of thumb, housing costing about five times annual income is what is counted as affordable and in this case, they had it less than five times. Having worked for some years already, they had saved enough in their CPF for the down payment. Now their monthly CPF contributions are enough to pay their instalments. So they have not had to pay any cash out of pocket for their flat, either for the down payment or the instalments.
Yong Kuang and Sabrina’s story is not unusual. 80 per cent of us live in public housing. It is the Singapore norm. It is not just for poor families, like elsewhere, but for a wide range of Singaporeans from all walks of life. Public housing in Singapore is really “national housing”. This did not happen by chance. We made it happen through sound policies, unwavering political resolve, and the strong support of Singaporeans. Our founding fathers started the Home Ownership Scheme in 1964. They wanted every citizen to benefit from the country’s growth and prosperity, and to have a valuable stake that would be theirs that they would defend, if necessary, with their lives. As a result, generations of Singaporeans have been uplifted by home ownership.
Take for example, a first generation resident in Ang Mo Kio. His four room flat would now be about 40 years old, and can fetch more than $400,000 in the resale market. In a good location, probably more. When he bought the flat 40 years ago, how much do you think he paid for it? $25,000. Even accounting for inflation, this is a huge appreciation. This is how we have enabled many Singaporeans to have a substantial asset to your name, even lower income households. In fact, if you take our homeowners who are 90 per cent of the population, and you look at the poorest one-fifth of homeowners, each have on average $200,000 of wealth in his or her HDB flat. $200,000 of wealth. That means you take the value of the flat, you subtract off his mortgage unpaid and he still has $200,000 to his name. This does not happen anywhere else.
Young couples buying a flat today probably would not see such a huge appreciation as the Ang Mo Kio resident who bought the flat 40 years ago, because our economy is maturing and it cannot grow as fast anymore. But you still get a good headstart because the Government helps you out with a subsidised flat or housing grants, and often both. And as long as our economy grows, the value of the flat will go up for many years, just not as dramatically
The oldest flats in Ang Mo Kio are about 40 years old. Sometimes residents ask what will happen to their flats as time passes and their leases run down. Will their flats still hold value? What options do they have? Why are their leases for 99 years? Can they be longer? Actually, 99 years is a very long time. Let’s say you buy a new flat from HDB in your early 30s. At the end of 99 years, you will be 130+ years old – and probably would not need this flat anymore. If you have children, they will also be very old, almost as old as the flat itself in their 80s or 90s. And if you have grandchildren, your grandchildren will already be grandparents. So, 99 years is a very long time.
In particular, when you retire, after living in your flat for 30 or 40 years, it will still have a good 60+ years of lease left. That is long enough for it to retain substantial value, and be a good retirement nest egg as you can see with the Ang Mo Kio example I gave you just now. You can continue living in the flat, rent out a room for income if needed, and one day, pass on the flat down to your children. Or you can right-size, sell it and move to a smaller unit. Or you can go for Lease Buyback and return the remaining lease to HDB, then use the money you get back for retirement. I explained how all this works in a previous National Day Rally, 2014. If you look up the clips on the YouTube, you will still find them there. But we can make things better. We can do several things to help residents monetise their older flats. We can expand the Lease Buyback scheme. We can do things to improve the liquidity of the resale market. That means to make it easier for people to buy and sell old flats, and MND is working on this.
What if you had bought a resale flat instead? Well, our oldest flats are at most 52 years old, so you have at least another 47 years left of your lease, which is still a long time. Very few of today’s HDB owners will outlive their leases. HDB estimates that it will happen to less than 2 per cent of households, including those who have bought resale flats. So it is not likely to happen to you. It could happen, but not likely. It could happen to your children if they inherit your flat. But this should not be a problem if your children buy their own BTO flat, with its own 99-year lease, as many do. Because then an inheritance for them would be a gift and a bonus. And even if you have to return your old flat at the end of its lease, do not worry because the Government will help you get another flat to live in. It may be a BTO flat from HDB with a fresh 99-year lease, if you are eligible for another one. It may be a resale flat on a shorter and cheaper lease. Or it may be a 2R Flexi flat for retirement. There are different options, depending on your needs and what you can afford. But whichever option you choose, you will have to pay for the lease. This is only fair, because you bought the original flat knowing when the lease would run out, and knowing that the flat would then have to be returned to HDB.
There is one fundamental reason why HDB leases are for 99 years and that is, we need to be fair to future generations. Let me explain. HDB sells the flat to you for 99 years. You own it, and you can pass it on for one or two generations. After that, the flat returns to the state, the Government redevelops the land, and builds new flats for future generations. This is the only way to recycle the land and ensure that all our descendants can buy new BTO flats of their own. If instead the Government had sold you the flat on freehold, that means in perpetuity. Sooner or later we would run out of land to build new flats for future generations. The owners would pass their flats down to some of their descendants, many generations into the future. Those lucky enough to have a flat, they become flat owner. Those not lucky enough to inherit a property would get nothing. So our society would split into property owners and those who cannot afford a property. I think that would be most unequal, and socially divisive. So, that is why 99 year leases are not just for HDB flats. In fact, for private housing also, the Government only sells land on 99 year leases.
There is also a practical reason why we cannot extend the leases easily. If you look at older buildings today, some look rather worn down, even before they are 50 years old. Some condominiums are like that, private property. After a century, I am sure the mechanical and electrical systems will be obsolete. The concrete will have deteriorated in our tropical climate. And even if we could fix all that, the recurrent maintenance costs would be very high. So it is better to let the leases expire, take the blocks back, demolish them and rebuild afresh. We may keep a few blocks which have historical or heritage value, or sentimental reason, or to remind people what the old days were like, but these should be the exception. For the others, we can rebuild newer, better, more liveable flats, blocks, and townships, more suited to what our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will want to live in. Today if I offer you to live in a 100-year old flat, I do not think there will be many takers because you want the mod cons. You want the lifts. You want the power supply. You want the modern sanitation. You want the convenience. You want the finishes, the styles. You want to be up to date. I think our grandchildren will also want to be up to date. It is better we take back. We rebuild. Singapore progresses while keeping an essence of its history and soul. That is why when the leases expire, the flats will have to return to the state.
There are still many decades before the first HDB leases expire. As the flats grow older, the Government will help you to keep them in good condition. We do this through HDB’s upgrading programmes. We started with the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) in the 1990s. This one happens to be in my own constituency and you can see each one of these red bars is one lift tower. This is one block, this is one block. It’s a block with seven lift towers at government expense, upgraded MUP and LUP together. Later, we replaced the MUP with the the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). The HIP has been very popular. It is an essential upgrade. We fix up maintenance problems, like spalling concrete, ceiling leaks, and damaged pipes. This is the new toilet after it has been upgraded. We upgrade the electrical supply too. This is a substation. Because more families have air-conditioners, washing machines, computers, and now personal mobility devices (PMDs), needing to be charged.
The HIP scheme is heavily subsidised. The Government pays up to 95 per cent, so residents pay as little as a few hundred dollars for the upgrading. Not surprising that after upgrading, the flat value usually goes up. We launched the HIP 10 years ago. The final batch of HIP flats will be announced by next year. So within a few years, all flats eligible for HIP will have been balloted. Hopefully, passed, executed and upgraded. That means altogether 450,000 flats upgraded under MUP plus HIP.
Now, HIP covers flats built up to 1986. We launched the programme a decade ago. So the flats which missed qualifying for HIP are also now starting to show their age. I know many HDB residents in these younger flats are also hoping for an upgrading. In estates like Yishun, Tampines and Jurong, there are flats built both before and after the 1986 cut-off. So people ask, why next door got HIP, my flat got no HIP. And then there is Pasir Ris, where residents started collecting keys in 1987. So, DPM Teo Chee Hean used to remind the Ministers regularly that Pasir Ris has not had any HIP projects. And I would console him regularly that Pasir Ris flats do not need any HIP yet, they don’t need HIP yet, you are new, very good. But still he said, my residents are waiting anxiously.
Now that the oldest Pasir Ris flats are 30 years old, they are no longer quite so new. Wear and tear is starting to show, so I am very happy to announce that we will expand the HIP and HIP will now include blocks built up to 1997. That means another 230,000 flats will benefit. So Pasir Ris will get HIP, the older flats. And so will Yishun, Tampines, Jurong and a number of other estates.
Beyond HIP, what more can we do as our flats grow older? The expanded HIP will include flats built up to 1997. In other words, the flats will get HIP about 30 years after they were built. After upgrading, these flats should be good for another 30 to 40 years. By that time, the flats will be 60 to 70 years old, and I expect they will be showing their age again. We are determined not to let our public housing degenerate into ragged, squalid slums, which has happened in many other cities. So we should do a second round of upgrading, at about the 60 to 70-year mark. Let us call this HIP II. 60 to 70 years old. HIP II will keep the flats safe and liveable, and also help them retain their value as their leases run down. It should see the flats through to the end of their leases. So in short, every HDB flat can expect to be upgraded twice during their lease. Once when they are about 30 years old, through the MUP or HIP, and a second time through HIP II, when they are about 60-70 years old. The first flats will reach 60-70 years old about 10 years from now. So that is when we plan to launch the HIP II programme.Akan datang.
HIP II is a huge financial commitment for the Government. If you own a private property, you are fully responsible for its upkeep and upgrading. But because HDB is public housing, the Government will upgrade each HDB flat not once, but twice during its lifespan. Furthermore, the Government will help you pay most of the upgrading cost. The first HIP will cost the Government more than $4 billion. HIP II will probably cost even more, because the flats will be twice as old by then. But it is well justified, and we will do it so long as MOF has the money.
I know what some of you are thinking. HIP and HIP II are fine if I want to stay on in my flat. But what if I want to move out? Can I get SERS – the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme? SERS is a very good scheme for estate rejuvenation. It brings new residents into the estate, often young families, who inject vitality into the community. I have two SERS projects in Teck Ghee, and recently I visited Teck Ghee Parkview. It replaced the BTO blocks which came into the SERS site. The new flats have made a noticeable difference to Teck Ghee – the estate is livelier, more children are running around, more young couples like this one whom I visited. It has cheered up the neighbourhood. Now we have more babies in Teck Ghee, some even able to dance with their mothers. So yes, SERS is indeed one option, if your flat happens to be SERS-ed and selected. But SERS is a very limited scheme. It is meant for selected HDB blocks or precincts, which have high development value which we can unlock. What does that mean? Take Tanglin Halt for example. It is in Queenstown. It is our first HDB township. It was not built optimally. The precincts were not always well laid out. There are low rise flats, the flats have layouts where there are large surface car parks, empty spaces, odd leftover spaces. So if you take it all back and redevelop it completely, Tanglin Halt is being SERS-ed, you can use the space better, you can create denser housing, greener environments. So from something like this, you can go to something like this, 40 years’ change or 50 years change. We are redeveloping Tanglin Halt through SERS, using the space better, and creating denser housing and greener environments. It makes economic sense in such cases for the Government to take back the flats early and redevelop the site. Because there is a lot of value unlocked, we share this value with residents through generous compensation. And with generous compensation, we can make the acquisition compulsory. In other words, HDB decides on SERS, and residents do not get to vote
However, HDB estimates that only around 5% of flats are suitable for SERS. There will be a few more SERS projects to come, but many projects with high redevelopment potential have already been done. Because HDB chose the promising ones and did them first.
So what about the flats that do not get SERS? Well, HDB has been studying this intensively, and I have good news to share tonight. More households will be able to benefit from redevelopment before their leases expire. Why? Because the Government has good reason to take back more flats, and redevelop them as they grow older, before 99 years are up. Let me explain. When HDB towns grow older, and the leases in the estates are nearing expiry, we have to redevelop the towns. We want to do this in an orderly way. In the early years, because of the housing shortage, HDB often built in a tremendous rush. Several older estates were built within short periods, especially in the 1970s and 1980s.  Marine Parade between 1974-1976 – within three years. Ang Mo Kio and Bedok, after that, 1975-1981 – within six to seven years. This one is Marine Parade. Therefore, if we do not plan ahead, 99 years later, all the leases in such towns will expire around the same time, and all the flats will be returned to the state within a few years. We will have to find new homes for a lot of people at once. HDB will have to tear down and rebuild the old flats in a hurry, just like when we first built Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok. I do not think that is a good idea. The towns will become construction sites all over again, with cranes all over the place. I think we should redevelop our old towns over 20 to 30 years, rather than within four to five years, progressively. That means starting when the oldest flats reach about 70 years old onwards. So some flats, you redevelop when you get to 70 years old, some 75, some 80 and you stretch it out over 20, 30 years and progressively do things in a measured and considered way. Then, just like with SERS, the estate and the community can be renewed progressively. There will be more new and younger residents moving in and the estate will become more vibrant. Those moving out will have somewhere to go to, and those staying will have rejuvenation to look forward to. This is why it makes sense for the Government to take back flats progressively over several decades, starting from about 70 years onwards, and stage out the redevelopment.
We will need a new scheme for this. Of course, we will compensate the residents whose flats are taken back early. We will also help them get another flat to live in, just like we would if their leases had run out. But the terms will be less generous than SERS, because there will less financial upside. There is social merit in it. There is community merit in it but there is not so much financial upside. Therefore, the scheme will be voluntary. I will call it VERS – Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme. So if you don’t get SERS-ed, you can hope to be VERS-ed. Residents in the precinct will have to vote for VERS, just like for HIP. If the residents vote yes, we will proceed. The Government will buy back the whole precinct, all the flats and redevelop, and residents can use their proceeds to help pay for another flat. If the residents vote no, then they can continue to live in their flats until their leases run out.
This is a long term plan. We will not start doing VERS for another 20 years. We need time to work out how to select the precincts, how to pace the redevelopments out, the specific terms of the Government’s offer and so on. We also need to study how to afford VERS for the long term. But I think such a scheme is necessary, so we will start planning for VERS now.
I have covered quite a bit of ground on housing. So let me do a quick recap. There is an examination later. First, we will expand HIP to upgrade 230,000 additional flats built between 1987 and 1997. This will happen when the flats are about 30 years old, and this will start soon. Second, we will do HIP II to upgrade flats a second time. This is a big project. This will happen when the flats reach 60-70 years old. HIP II will start in about 10 years’ time. Third, we will have VERS to progressively redevelop precincts in ageing housing estates. This will happen from about the 70th year onwards. VERS will start 20 years from now.
Eleven years ago, at NDR 2007, I showed a CGI fly-through of what we hoped Punggol would look like one day. Some of you may remember watching it. At that time, Punggol 21 Plus was still just a gleam in the eyes of our HDB planners. Recently, Lawrence Wong showed me a new fly-through of Punggol, this time using a drone – real life, not CGI. Let me show you the video. We start from outer space. We fly in. We proposed to create a Punggol Waterway, to build a town on both sides and if you fly along the waterway, this is what we thought it would look like. And 10 years, and a lot of hard work later, you cross the bridge and it becomes reality. This is HDB housing. There are parks. There are green areas. There are schools. This is a commercial development. It is Oasis (Terraces) – the Punggol Polyclinic is there. This is Waterway Cascadia, another HDB development. And back to the future. This is the Punggol Digital District which is adjacent to the SIT campus, Singapore Institute of Technology. Thank you for joining my guided tour.
What my Government envisioned more than 10 years ago, we have made reality. This has been the story of Singapore for more than 50 years. We said this would be a metropolis — and so it came to pass. We will continue to transform our city, our whole island. We will never let Singapore become a shabby shadow of some past glory, but always keep it a vibrant and attractive place to live. We are creating green corridors, expanding Changi Airport, moving PSA to Tuas, and building a new city centre on the Southern Waterfront. We are planning and building new HDB towns. Bidadari is already under construction. Next is Tengah in the west and later, Caldecott, each with unique concepts. Later, after Paya Lebar Airbase has moved to Changi, we will redevelop the eastern part of the island. And in 30 to 40 years’ time, we will rebuild our existing towns into the future Marine Parade; the future Ang Mo Kio; the future Bedok, and others. Each development will learn from the previous one and be even better. We are designing each town so that the community remains youthful and vibrant, and the facilities serve a wide range of needs and interests, for now and the future, townships for all ages. Just as we turned Punggol 21 Plus from CGI to reality, we will make these other plans come true. Then future PMs can show them off at their NDRs too. HDB will be very busy. They may have to change their name to HRB – the Housing Redevelopment Board. Indeed, we will never be done building Singapore.

Tonight, I have spoken about major shifts in our external environment. I have described our plans to improve healthcare and public housing. These are fundamental commitments by my Government to you. They are ambitious endeavours, and will require large expenditures. These schemes will stretch over 50 years and more. Several generations, and many General Elections. But we are planting the seeds now – conceiving the plans, investing the resources, building the institutions. The benefits will be felt by ourselves, our children and our grandchildren, decades from now – 10 years before we start doing HIP II. 20 years before we start VERS and if you are 30 years old, and get enrolled in CareShield Life, it may be 50 years before you need the payouts, longer if you are lucky.
Very few countries can make such long term plans, and anticipate needs and opportunities into the distant future. But in Singapore, we can, and we will. This Government believes it owes it to you to look ahead, share our thinking with you, pool our ideas, and work with you to make it happen. Our plans will not unfold exactly as we predict, because nobody can tell what will befall us over the next half century. What new technologies will disrupt the world? Will it be a world where countries big and small can work together? Will there be war or peace? But whatever the future brings, we know what Singapore must strive for, to give ourselves the best chances of success. We must have a thriving economy and sound Government finances, to generate the resources to carry out our projects. We must maintain political stability and outstanding leadership, so that we can continue to plan for the future. And most important of all, we must always stay one united people, and work together to build a better Singapore for ourselves.
Building and rebuilding Singapore is not just about satisfying material needs. The human spirit must flourish in Singapore. Recently, the National Geographic magazine published a special issue on Singapore: City of Tomorrow. You can pick up a copy later after the Rally. The issue celebrates ordinary Singaporeans doing extraordinary things, taking the path less travelled, excelling in their own fields.
One of them is Mark Ong, an artist who designs customised sneakers for celebrities and shoe companies under his own brand name SBTG, pronounced “sabotage”. You would never have guessed it, but it works. It all started when he won an online competition in 2003 and overnight had an order for 72 pairs of sneakers. He sold those first pairs for US$300 each, and his earlier works now sell for thousands of dollars. I wish my old sneakers were as valuable. To Mark, this is a dream come true, as he has loved drawing since he was a child, inspired by the art and creativity of his parents. Congratulations Mark.
There are many Singaporeans just like Mark, following their passions, breaking new ground, doing Singapore proud. Let me share with you a few I have come across recently:
This is Dr Azhar Ali, a Senior Research Scientist at the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore. Azhar is leading a team of researchers from Singapore and the US to study lung cancer. The team recently made a breakthrough because they discovered that a slimming drug could help bring lung cancer under control. Syabas Azhar.
These are Darius Cheung and Roshni Mahtani. DPM Teo met them in Jakarta and told me about them. They are husband and wife, both digital entre-preneurs. Each with their own online business – his and hers. Darius co-founded 99.co, a search platform for property that connects agents, buyers and sellers, not just in Singapore but also Indonesia, which by the way has a very lively start up and tech scene and there are many opportunities there. Roshni founded a media company that operates theAsianparent.com, a website popular with many Singaporean parents with young children. Well done Darius and Roshni.
This is Sim Chi Yin. She is an award winning documentary photographer and artist. She was commissioned as the Nobel Peace Prize photographer last year, the first Asian to be chosen, and travels to places like North Korea to pursue her very adventurous projects. She recently joined Magnum Photos, an acclaimed international photographic cooperative. You cannot apply. You have to be invited to join. Chi Yin is not able to be here, but I am happy to have her parents with us tonight.
This is Michael Ker, who gave up his career as a pharmacist to take over his father’s popiah business and carry on his 79-year old family legacy. If you look very carefully these are the popiahs and he also sells kueh pie tee. Michael now travels the world to introduce his popiah and promote Singapore food. All the best Michael.
And, finally, Wong Kah Chun, a conductor and composer. Kah Chun grew up in a Chinese-speaking family. He discovered Western classical music as a young boy at Jurong Primary School. His math teacher was in charge of the school band, and asked him to join it. Through his school band, Kah Chun found his love for music, pursued his music education and won a scholarship to the NUS-Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music. After that a National Arts Council (NAC) scholarship to do his Masters’ in Germany. School bands started in 1965. Soon after we became independent, Mr Lee Kuan Yew made school bands a priority. This gave many students from modest backgrounds the opportunity to pick up music. In our first National Day Parade in 1966, many newly formed school bands marched with pride, wearing their new uniforms. This was before Kah Chun was born. Today, aged 32, Kah Chun is the chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra in Germany – a prestigious appointment. Next year, Kah Chun will be a guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra for their Lunar New Year concert. Kah Chun also co-founded Project Infinitude, an initiative to bring music to less privileged and special needs children, in Singapore and elsewhere. He is giving back to society, so that others can discover music just like he did. Here he is with the kids at Child at Street 11, a non-profit organisation that runs a pre-school in Ang Mo Kio. But when Kah Chun comes home to his HDB flat in Jurong West that he grew up in – second floor, still no air con, sweaty at night – he says it is still “the best because it is home, and better than any hotel”.
These are just a few of many, many Singaporeans who are pursuing dreams, breaking new ground, and flying our flag high. We rejoice in their successes. They show the world that here in Singapore, passion can indeed be made possible. Our forefathers transformed Singapore from mudflats to a metropolis. Thanks to them, today we are in an immensely stronger position. With what we now have, we can achieve so much more together. 100 years from now, Singapore should stand out not just for its modern skyscrapers and world rankings, but for being a nation of boundless opportunities. A society where every skill and talent is recognised, developed and celebrated and where those who have done well contribute back to society, and help others to do better. As one of the Primary 2 MGS girls puts it: “Singapore may be a small country but we have big hearts”. Let us live up to that ambition. Let us continue to stand tall, chase rainbows, and work together for many brighter tomorrows. Thank you, and good night.

   singaporewebsite update april",9775,"In his speech, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted several key developments and plans for Singapore, emphasizing the nation's role on the international stage and its internal advancements. Singapore successfully hosted a historic summit between US President Donald Trump and DPRK Chairman Kim Jong Un, showcasing its reliability and capability in managing high-profile international events. Domestically, Singapore continues to focus on enhancing public housing and healthcare systems to ensure affordability and quality for its citizens.

The Prime Minister discussed the economic challenges posed by global trade tensions, particularly the impacts of tariffs and the need for countries to act with restraint and wisdom. He stressed the importance of ASEAN and maintaining strong relationships with neighboring countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, noting recent political changes in these nations and their potential impact on bilateral relations.

Significant attention was given to domestic policies, especially the enhancements in healthcare with initiatives like MediShield Life and the introduction of CareShield Life, aimed at providing lifelong financial support for severe disabilities. On housing, the Prime Minister outlined plans to ensure the longevity and affordability of public housing through schemes like the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) and the introduction of the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (VERS) to progressively renew older estates.

Overall, the speech underscored Singapore's proactive stance in both foreign diplomacy and domestic policy, focusing on long-term stability and prosperity for its citizens."
2019,"
My fellow Singaporeans, good evening.
This year, we commemorate our Bicentennial, two hundred years of Singapore’s modern history.
We began in January at the Singapore River. Since then, many community groups, businesses, schools and even individuals have marked the Bicentennial in their own ways, and reflected on their own histories. I recently attended the Eurasian Festival. This marked 100 years of the Eurasian Association, and showcased our unique Eurasian history and culture. Earlier in April, five Indian dance groups held a combined performance, the Natya Yatra, at the Esplanade. They were celebrating 100 years of Indian classical dance in Singapore. There have been many events in the heartlands too. In Teck Ghee, we organised “Happily ever after – then and now” to celebrate the diverse and changing wedding customs in Singapore. Some 90 couples, old and young, took the occasion to renew their wedding vows. It was a meaningful and joyous event. For Jalan Kayu, former residents recreated what their kampong looked like in the good old days, including the barber chair along the five-foot way. One of them, Uncle Ng Ah Chye, told vivid stories about life in the 1960s, almost like “李大傻讲古”. He had served in the Police Reserve Unit, and helped restore order in Geylang during the 1964 racial riots. Uncle Ng also helped to rescue residents during floods. The young people who think that floods are a very unusual thing asked him which year. Of course he could not remember because it happened many years. Uncle Ng also took part in our very first National Day Parade in 1966!
For this year’s Parade, we were honoured to have the leaders of our three closest neighbours, Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia as our guests, and hundreds of thousands of us have visited the Bicentennial Experience at Fort Canning. The vivid re-enactments brought our rich and complex history to life, and reminded us why we are proud to be Singaporean. We had planned to close the show after the September school holidays. But we have received so many requests to extend it. So we have decided to extend the Bicentennial Experience to the end of the Bicentennial year. I hope you will go and see it if you have not already done so. It is well-worth. This will give more people the chance to see it.
All these activities help us trace our long history, and appreciate the broader context that has shaped and created modern Singapore. In our journey, we overcame many difficulties, adapted to drastic changes in our world, and blazed bold paths forward. As we look towards the future, we will need this resourcefulness and resolve more than ever.
We have a full agenda. In my Malay speech earlier, I spoke about education and upgrading, and the importance of practising our faiths in open and inclusive ways to strengthen our unity and harmony. I spoke about Islam primarily, but it applies to all faiths. In Mandarin, I spoke about external challenges, particularly what US-China tensions mean for us. I also discussed the economic situation, and how we are preparing our workers and companies to cope – short-term and long-term. These are important issues, which concern all Singaporeans.
In my English speech, I want to talk about three other important things. First, enabling every young person to succeed, regardless of his or her background. Second, supporting people to work for longer, as we are living longer, and third, protecting ourselves from climate change, and renewing our city for the next century.
Let me start with how we are giving our young the best possible start in life. So that anyone who works hard will have a chance to succeed, regardless of starting point or family background. Because this is what meritocracy in Singapore is about.
We have made good on this promise by investing heavily in education. Our starting point used to be primary one. School brought everyone up to speed. Not just on academics, but also basic health and development. We introduced dental check-ups, as well as vaccinations. If you were underweight in primary school, you may remember the School Milk Scheme too. Generations of children have been through our schools. They received a sound education and good healthcare, and graduated better educated than their parents. Recently, Save The Children, an international NGO, ranked Singapore the best place in the world for a child to grow up in, and last year, the World Bank published a Human Capital Index. This measures the knowledge, skills, and health that a child born today can expect to attain by age 18. Among 157 countries, Singapore ranked first. So when they launched the Index in Bali at the IMF World Bank conference, they invited me to go and they interviewed me on our experience. A brief 15 minutes, not quite a National Day Rally. How we made this journey. But the journey is not over. But we are going further. We want to start earlier in a child’s life, because these years make a big difference to his development. Parents play an important role. But a good preschool education can make a crucial difference. That is why several years ago, we made a major shift to improve preschool education. Let me share what we have done so far, and what more we plan to do.
First, we have doubled full-day preschool capacity, to almost 180,000 places It is enough places for every child aged three and above. Young parents in newer estates, like Sengkang and Punggol, are much happier. Their MPs too, because the queues have shortened – queues at preschools, and also queues at Meet the People sessions!
Second, we have upgraded the preschools. The new HDB void deck centres are better designed and appointed. We have built some mega centres too with comprehensive facilities. Like this PCF Sparkletots centre at Punggol. It looks like a holiday resort, but the kids are expected to study quite hard there. The children have plenty of space to run around and enjoy a wider range of activities. When I visited, these kids were in their cooking studio, making pizza! They asked me to pretend to be the teacher – I said, I do not know how to make pizza, so please show me – which is what they are doing.
Third, we set up MOE Kindergartens. By operating kindergartens, MOE gains direct experience, improves curriculum design, and ultimately raises standards across the industry. MOE Kindergarten is also a new preschool model. Each MOE Kindergarten is located together with a primary school. Each kindergarten offers all three Mother Tongue Languages, and provides a bilingual environment, just like a primary school. Today, we have 24 MOE Kindergartens, and will more than double the number in the next few years.
Fourth, we are giving pre-school teachers better training and career progression. We have set up the National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) to upgrade training for preschool teachers and raise their standing. NIEC enrolled its first students this year. So these NIEC students are kindergarten teachers or will be kindergarten teachers. Some are fresh trainees. Others are experienced teachers like Palaniammal, also called Sheila. Sheila started out as a preschool teacher. Over time, she upgraded herself, with a Diploma in Teaching and an Advanced Diploma in Leadership. Now, she is a Vice Principal at a PCF preschool. Sheila really enjoys working with children, and is very good at her job. Last year, MOE recognised her as an Outstanding Preschool Mother Tongue Language Teacher. But Sheila aspires to do even better. Recently, she enrolled in NIEC, to specialise in Tamil Language Teaching. With dedicated teachers like Sheila, our children are in good hands. Well done, Sheila!
Fifth, we continue to make preschool more affordable. The Government funds the Anchor Operators and Partner Operators, to keep fees down. And all parents receive significant subsidies for childcare, with lower income parents receiving substantially more. Still, for middle income parents, preschool fees can take up a chunk of their household budget. Especially if two or more kids are in preschool at the same time.
Like the Low family, for example. They are middle-income. Both parents are working. They have two sons: Kaylen who is turning 5, and Kyler who is 2. Both boys attend a government-supported preschool.
To help families like the Lows, we will enhance preschool subsidies. The Lows currently do not qualify for additional means-tested subsidies, because their household income exceeds the current maximum income, which is $7,500. We will raise the income ceiling to $12,000 per month. This will extend the means-tested subsidies to 30,000 more households, including the Lows. On top of this, we will also increase the quantum of preschool subsidies, across the board.
Before the changes, Mr and Mrs Low pay about $560 per month for each child’s preschool. The enhanced subsidy will knock off a third of their preschool expenses, which will then go down to around $370 per child. Later on, when Kaylen and Kyler enter primary school, the family’s expenses will go down even further. Because primary school itself is almost free – you have to pay a few dollars miscellaneous fees. If the boys need student care after school in the afternoons, it will cost the Lows about $300 per child. So it is even lower than the $370 that they will be paying after the enhanced subsidies. In the medium term, we aim to bring down full-day preschool expenses to around that level – which means the cost of primary school plus afterschool student care is $370 coming down to around $300. We need a while to get there, but we are working towards this.
Recently several PAP women Members of Parliament (MPs), led by SPS Sun Xueling, surveyed young parents on preschool. Understandably, the parents were concerned about affordability. The MPs made an important point: that preschool should be like housing and healthcare, where we have a good and affordable government-funded option for all Singaporeans. There is a private option if you want, but for many Singaporeans, in fact, the majority, the government-funded option is high quality and more than satisfactory.
I agree with them. For housing we have HDB. For healthcare, we have restructured hospitals. Similarly, for preschool, we should have good quality, government-supported choices available to all Singaporeans. This is in fact our policy. Today, just over half of all pre-school places are government-supported. Over time, we will bring this up to 80%, just like HDB and we are putting a lot of resources towards this. Already, the Government spends about $1 billion a year on early childhood education, and this will more than double over the next few years. Hopefully with all these improvements, parents will no longer think of preschools as an expensive phase of bringing up their children.
The younger ministers have a few more ideas to support couples to have more kids, and to keep HDB flats affordable. I will leave them to make the announcements later. Meanwhile I will be counting the number of babies born, and hoping for the number to go up!
I want to update you on one more programme, and that is KidSTART. We piloted KidSTART three years ago, to give extra help to 1,000 children from less privileged families. The KidSTART team advises and supports the parents, often a single parent – on nutrition, child development, and parent-child interaction. We are very happy with the results, and so are the parents. Let’s take a look at the video.
KidSTART is a good programme. I am confident we are on the right track. We still need to follow up for a few more years, to assess more exactly its benefits. But for each new cohort of babies, there is no time to lose. So we will expand KidSTART to reach another 5,000 children over the next three years. Then we will take stock again how to expand KidSTART further.
The commitment to do our best for every child is deeply embedded in our education system. That is why we heavily subsidise school fees from preschool to university, polytechnic and ITE. So that every child can afford a good education.

I recently received a letter from an NUS law student, Quek Lu Yi. Lu Yi wrote about how she felt a sense of inferiority when she was growing up, because many of her classmates came from better-off families. Let me read from her letter. She said as she grew older, she realised that “this was an extremely misplaced sense of shame. My parents had done nothing wrong. They’d supported me throughout my life and gave me the best they could.” A few years before Lu Yi entered NUS, her family ran into difficulty. Lu Yi worried about becoming a burden on her family. She already had one sibling in university and another about to start. And even after she started her law course, financial concerns were frequently on her mind – buying books, a laptop, school trips and other activities. But she applied for and received a bursary, which significantly eased her financial worries.
MOE has done a comprehensive review of tertiary fees and bursaries. First, MOE looked at whether our universities can operate more economically. Two of them, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), are more applied, and do more industry attachments and internships. Their operating costs per student can be lower, especially as student intakes grow. So MOE will lower the annual fees for the full-time general degree programmes in SIT and SUSS, from around $8,000 now, to $7,500.
Second, MOE will significantly enhance government bursaries. For university courses, we will increase government bursaries from up to 50 per cent of general degree fees today, to up to 75 per cent. For a general degree programme in NUS, like Economics or Computer Science, full fees are about $8,000 a year. Currently, a lower income student would pay around half that, $4,000 a year, if he uses his bursary fully to his fees. With the enhanced bursary, he would pay only $2,000 per year. Similarly, for polytechnic diploma programmes, we will increase the bursary coverage from up to 80 per cent of the fees today, to up to 95 per cent. For polytechnic diploma, full fees are now $3,000. With a bursary, a lower income poly student currently pays about $600 a year. After we enhance the bursary, he will pay only $150. I have given examples of lower income students. Actually, 6 in 10 students in our polytechnics and universities are eligible for government bursaries. So these enhancements will benefit many middle income students too. Students in Government-funded diploma and degree programmes at ITE, NAFA, and LASALLE will also be covered.
I want to say something about one particular university course, and that is Medicine. It is very expensive to train a medical student. Hence, Medicine has the highest course fees of all the university courses. Today, after Government subsidies, medical school fees are almost $29,000 a year at NUS, and $35,000 a year at NTU. These are not small amounts.
We should not let the cost of medical school deter good students from studying medicine. In fact, we want doctors to have diverse educational and family backgrounds. On the educational front, recent medical school intakes have included more polytechnic graduates, and this year, we had one ITE graduate for the first time, in NUS medical school. But on the socio-economic front, we should do more to encourage lower income students to do medicine. Therefore, we will enhance government bursaries for medical school, to make them significantly more generous than bursaries for other courses. If you add together other bursaries from the university, then lower income students will now pay at most $5,000 per year to study Medicine. This balance can be covered by student loans with much less difficulty. So, if you are a student and you are worried about your finances and you have an ambition to be a doctor, I say do not worry about the money. That will be taken care of. Go for it.
All these fee and bursary adjustments I have talked about, for both medical and non-medical courses, will apply to both existing and new students, from the next academic year.
The point of these changes to fees and bursaries is not just the dollars and cents. We are determined to make our education system as accessible as possible. We want every Singaporean son and daughter to have the opportunity to receive a good education, and start well in life, regardless of family circumstances. Students from less privileged backgrounds must be confident that they will get financial help, if they need it to see them through their education. They should neither feel disadvantaged nor inferior comparing themselves to better off classmates, nor should they be deterred from pursuing a course just because of money. This is fundamental to maintaining Singapore as an open meritocracy.
Apart from government bursaries, our universities, polytechnics and ITE also raise funds to create their own bursaries. These bursaries often have names associated with them, like the EW Barker Bursary in NUS named after our founding Law Minister, or the Class of 1995 Term Bursary in NTU. The Class of 1995, that means the graduating class of 1995, must have come together and raised some money, endowed a bursary, to remind the next generation that when it comes to your turn to, go thou and do likewise. This personalises the bursary award. The recipient is grateful to the donor, the donor is happy to have done a good deed, and both donor and recipient honour the person after whom the bursary is named. And in time, hopefully the recipient will make good, remember, and be moved to pay it forward.
Lu Yi, the NUS student who wrote to me, received such a bursary. Hers was a Kwa Geok Choo Bursary, which the NUS Law School had established in my mother’s name. She wrote to me because I think I was one of those who contributed to the bursary fund. She wrote in her letter: “Thank you for opening my eyes to the compassion and generosity of our society, for being the helping hand and for setting my mind at ease. This is a kindness that will stay with me through my life and I hope to be able to do my part and help others in similar positions in the future”. Thank you, Lu Yi. We wish you all the best for your studies.
We try very hard to kindle the same warm personal feeling with Government bursaries, but alas, it is not so easy to write a letter like that to say “Dear Government, thank you very much”. So to complement the Government bursaries, I hope the universities, polytechnics and ITE will set up more bursaries of their own, in people’s names. And I hope the alumni and community will contribute generously too. The Government will match your donations, up to 3 times for the newer universities, and up to 1.5 times for the rest. Our institutions often raise funds for new buildings and professorships, and this is always meritorious. But bursaries can make a crucial difference to the recipients – and they have the extra human touch. If you donate towards a bursary, you enable some promising young person to get a good start in life. This strengthens our sense of obligation to each other, and the bonds that link us all together as one society.
Our education system gives young Singaporeans a headstart when they enter the job market. But our support does not end there. As people progress in their careers, SkillsFuture will help to keep their knowledge and skills up to date. We need to do this, because jobs and skills are turning over faster than ever.
We also need to keep on re-skilling ourselves for another reason. Singaporeans are living longer, and mostly also want to work longer. So, my next topic is about helping Singaporeans work longer, if they wish to do so.
Our life expectancy at birth – the latest figures which came out just a few weeks ago – is now the longest in the world – nearly 85 years , even longer than Japan! This means about half of us can expect to live longer than 85 years. We all know many people who are older than 85. Quite a few turned up for my National Day Observance Ceremony in Teck Ghee, including this sprightly lady, Mdm Liang Juat Eng. She is 102. In the Rally in 2007, when I talked about ageing, I checked out the numbers and reported that we then had 500 centenarians – people aged 100 and over. This year, for my speech, I said please update the number, and In just over a decade, the number has more than doubled – we now have 1,300 centenarians, including Mdm Liang! That means every MP has about 14 of them – should look them up. I hope some of them are watching my speech on TV. This means Singaporeans stay healthy for longer too, protected by MediShield Life.
Most seniors in fact do not want to stop working. We are healthy for longer and living longer, but we do not want to spend more years idle in retirement. We want to stay active and engaged, to feel a sense of worth and purpose. Also many of us want to build up a bigger nest egg for when we eventually retire. Therefore, many of us have multiple careers in a lifetime.
Enabling seniors to continue working productively takes a joint effort. Employers must redesign their training, jobs, and careers around the abilities and strengths of the older workers. The older workers may not be as strong or quick as their younger colleagues, but this is actually not a problem in many jobs, where we can redesign the job, or we can use technology. This way, employers can continue to tap on the skills, knowledge and experience of our older workers. Employees, on their part, must adopt the right mindset. We must be ready to adapt, learn new things, and take on different responsibilities. We cannot just be satisfied doing our old jobs well, because many jobs will change. And some jobs will disappear – shorthand typists and telephone switchboard operators do not exist anymore. Re-skilling ourselves must start early even when we are in our 40s and 50s, if not even earlier. But 40s, and 50s, you are not quite so young any more, but not yet old. And you have to pay attention. Because if you do it then, then you will have useful skills which will be valuable. We hope as you near retirement age, and you can keep improving even in our 60s. And of course, Government will fully support both employers and employees in this endeavour.
I visited Workforce Singapore’s Careers Connect centre in January. There, I met Nahariah Mohd Nor, 47. She used to be a bank teller. Nowadays banks need fewer tellers because of online banking, ATMs, and now VTMs, or video teller machines, which are more advanced than ATMs. Nahariah took up an offer by her employer to retrain as a Customer Service Officer for VTMs. She does not stand around at the VTMs; she is sitting at a console in an ops room, monitoring multiple VTMs. When customers have problems with the VTM, they press the Help button on the machine. Nahariah’s face pops up on the screen, and she advises customers what to do. She told me, usually the first question she is asked is: “Are you real or are you AI?” So she smiles and goes: “No, no, I’m real!” The customers may be a bit doubtful at first because the AI can be very good, but very soon they can tell she has the human touch. As a result, Nahariah is doing a new job, serves more customers than she used to, and can be productive and employable for many more years. Well done, Nahariah!
I should also commend Nahariah’s employer, DBS. DBS has made great efforts to modernise itself, and to adopt technology. In the past one year, it was named the best bank in the world by three major industry publications. Most importantly, DBS has been working very hard to retrain its employees. It has shown care and concern for its people, even as it transforms itself. In fact, if they did not share care and concern for its people, it could not have become the best bank in the world. This is the right approach, and I encourage other companies to emulate DBS’ example. Good job Lah, DBS!
It is not just big companies that can retrain and upgrade workers. So can SMEs. This is Chan Ban Kiong. He is 64 – much older than Nahariah! Ban Kiong has been in the marine industry for over 30 years. He works for Mencast Marine, which makes and repairs ship propellers. He used to make ship propellers by hand. First, he crafts a mould out of sand, to create a prototype propeller. He uses this aluminium prototype to make a second mould. Finally, he casts the bronze propeller itself. It is hard work, and requires experience and skill. Mencast decided to increase productivity by using 3D printers to manufacture the propeller prototypes. But they still valued the experienced eye of their older workers, to ensure the quality of the work. So they are training Ban Kiong and eight colleagues to operate the 3D printers – and all of them are over 60! Now, their work will become safer and easier, and the production time will be faster by a third. So it is win-win-win, for the workers, company and customers too, and that is the way it should be. Well done, Mencast and Ban Kiong! I hope more companies will likewise help their older workers remain employable well into their 60s.

They made four key recommendations. First, to raise the Retirement Age from 62 today to 65. Second, to raise the Re-employment Age from 67 today to 70. Third, to increase CPF contributions for older workers. Fourth, to achieve all this in gradual steps, by about 2030. I think these are sensible recommendations. The Government accepts them in full. Let me explain them in a little more, and I will start with CPF contributions, which is a little more complicated. Today, CPF contribution rates for workers begin to taper down after the workers turn 55. We will raise the rates for workers above 55. We will take the first step in 2021. And we will take subsequent steps after that. The whole process will take 10 years or so, about there, but it depends on economic conditions. By the time we are done, those 60 and below will enjoy the full CPF rates. The CPF rates will only begin to taper down after 60, and level off after 70. So this is the first change – to increase CPF for older workers gradually over the next 10 years or so.
Next, in 2022, we will start to raise both the Retirement Age and Re-employment Age for all employers. The Retirement Age will go from 62 – which is what it is today – to 63 in 2022, and eventually to 65 by 2030. The Re-employment Age will go from 67 – which is where it is now – to 68, also in 2022, and eventually to 70, by 2030. Therefore, by 2030, we should reach our 1st and 2nd objectives, which means Retirement Age goes to 65, and Re-employment Age goes to 70.
The Government will help businesses to adjust to these new arrangements. We will implement a support package for them and DPM Heng Swee Keat will announce them in next year’s Budget.
As a major employer ourselves, the Government will take the lead for public officers. The Public Service will raise its Retirement and Re-employment Ages one year earlier, in 2021 instead of 2022. I encourage private sector companies which can do the same, also to do so.
All these changes – to the Retirement Age, the Re-employment Age, and the CPF rates – will support older workers to continue working longer and to be more financially independent.
Let me add one last point here, to be absolutely clear: we are not making any changes to CPF withdrawal policies or CPF withdrawal ages. You can still take out some money at age 55. And you can still start your CPF payouts from age 65. All that remains exactly the same. So please ignore any rumours you may hear about this, or messages on WhatsApp, because they are fake news!
Next, let me talk about renewing our city and our home for the next century. I will start with climate change. Climate change may seem abstract and distant for many of us. But it is one of the gravest challenges facing humankind. Our young people instinctively appreciate the seriousness of the issue. When the National Youth Council recently asked young people what their vision was for Singapore’s future, many spoke about the environment. Let’s hear from them.
What is climate change? What is it about and why should we be concerned? Let me try to explain a huge and complicated subject simply and briefly. Human activity is pumping more and more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. We produce CO2. When we drive a car or take a plane. Or run a manufacturing plant. Or use electrical appliances at home, because nearly all our electricity is generated from natural gas, which is a fossil fuel. The CO2 builds up in the atmosphere, traps heat from the sun, and causes the planet to warm up.
Already, the Earth’s average temperature has gone up by 1 degree Celsius compared to pre-industrial times, over 100 years ago. One degree Celsius does not sound like much, but it is very significant. Furthermore, temperatures are continuing to rise, faster and faster. Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting into the oceans, and this is raising sea levels around the world. The UN currently projects that sea levels will rise by up to one metre by the end of this century, about three feet, just 80 years from now. But the scientists’ estimates have been going up. So sea levels may quite possibly rise higher and faster than that. Global warming is also making the weather more extreme. Droughts are getting more severe and prolonged. Rainfall and storms are becoming more intense.
Singapore is already feeling the impact. Our weather is palpably hotter. Rainstorms are heavier. And this will very likely worsen over the next few decades, within the lifetimes of many of us. A recent Swiss study found that by 2050, just 30 years from now, several cities in the world will experience unprecedented climate shifts. And it found that one of them will be Singapore.
We must prepare for the impact of climate change on Singapore. There are many risks and consequences. New diseases, more frequent pandemics, food shortages, forced migration of displaced populations, and even wars. Because we are a low-lying island, Singapore is especially vulnerable to one grave threat, and that is rising sea levels.
In the 1960s and 70s, floods were common in Singapore, especially during the rainy season. That is why Uncle Ng Ah Chye from Jalan Kayu, whom I told you about earlier, had to rescue stranded residents whenever it flooded. When we had high tides, monsoon drains in low-lying parts of Singapore would fill up almost to the brim, even if it was not raining. And if it did rain, it would flood. Gan Kim Yong told me when he was a child, his family lived in Hong Kong Street in Chinatown, where his father ran a shop. This is Temple Street, but it looked like this also. When there was an exceptionally high tide, which happened a few times a year, the tide water would rise up from the drains onto the five-foot way in front of the shop even without rain. So his father had to build racks to stack up his goods, out of reach of the water. To Kim Yong, who was then a boy, this was great fun. But actually it was a serious matter.
These old flooding problems are now largely resolved. We improved the drainage system. We required buildings to be built on higher platforms, at least three metres above the mean sea level. Three metres sounds a lot because most of us are less than two metres tall. But three meters is not actually that high, because at high tide, the water can go up as high as two metres above the mean sea level. That leaves just a one metre buffer to cope with other factors. For example, heavy rain. If it rains, it fills up a little bit and the water has some where to go. Because of this one metre buffer, we have managed to deal with our flooding problems thus far. But, with global warming, if sea levels rise by one metre, our buffer is gone. Because when it is high tide, two metres above that, water is already reaching the five-foot way. Because if heavy rain coincides with a high tide, the water will have nowhere to go. We will, literally, be in deep water!
Like Bangladesh whenever they are hit by a cyclone. Or, to take an extreme example, like New Orleans, much of which is below sea level – here you can see how the city was completely flooded when Hurricane Katrina hit it in 2005.
So what can we do? Three things: understand climate change, mitigate climate change, and adapt to climate change. Let me explain them one by one.
First, we have to understand what climate change means specifically for Singapore. Is it hot weather, extreme weather, drought, intense rain, sea levels, and therefore what do we do. So we have set up a Centre for Climate Research Singapore, CCRS. I visited them earlier this year. They have a team of scientists and meteorologists, and supercomputers to model the weather and do research. They showed me the records they have, which go back more than a century. Including these old weather diaries – which I am looking at. They go back to the 1930s, which were meticulously kept at the weather station on Mount Faber.
CCRS is cooperating with their counterparts in neighbouring countries to study in more detail how climate change is affecting Southeast Asia. They are finding that Singapore, being near the equator, is more vulnerable to climate change than the global model suggests.
Second, we must mitigate climate change. What does mitigate mean? It means we must do our part to reduce CO2 emissions. Singapore has joined international efforts to reduce emissions. We are part of the Paris Climate Agreement, and we have committed to slow down and ultimately cap our CO2 emissions by around 2030. To help achieve this, last year we introduced a carbon tax. Each of us can do our bit to promote sustainability and mitigate climate change. Like remembering to switch off the lights, reducing waste, and reusing and recycling more.
In Singapore, we generate a huge amount of waste – whether from excessive packaging, food waste, or electronic waste. These all have to be disposed of, and often incinerated, which then generates more CO2. Our landfill is at Pulau Semakau. But that will eventually fill up, and then we will need Bukit Semakau, and then Gunung Semakau! So we have to find a sustainable solution.
This is where young Singaporeans have been doing their part. Like Farah Sanwari, who is passionate about sustainability. Farah co-founded Repair Kopitiam a few years ago, to teach others how to repair damaged electronic appliances, furniture, toys and clothing. So these items can gain a new lease of life and you can use them longer, instead of being thrown away prematurely. We need more young Singaporeans to be like Farah, to be problem-solvers, innovators, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs. As the song suggests, be prepared to do our part. This is the Grand Challenge for their generation.
Although Singapore may not be able to stop climate change by ourselves, we can contribute to solutions, and we must do our fair share. Then we can be credible asking others to reduce their emissions too, and work towards a global solution to climate change. Unfortunately, such a global solution is still very far off. So we must work for the best, but be prepared for the worst.
Therefore, the third thing we must do, is to adapt to climate change, and especially rising sea levels. We will need local measures to protect individual buildings and developments – and we have been doing this. For example, we have built MRT stations with elevated entrances. When you enter an MRT station, you need to climb up a few steps before you go down the escalator. This is flood protection for our MRT system. If we need to raise our steps to be built higher, we will do that one day. We also require new developments to be built on higher platforms, instead of building three metres above mean sea level like before, they must now be at least four metres above mean sea level. For critical infrastructure like Changi Airport Terminal 5 and Tuas Port, we are raising the platforms even higher, at least five metres above mean sea level. But local measures will not be enough. We have many older buildings. These cannot be lifted up, or transported to higher ground. In fact, large parts of Singapore are low-lying, and we need to protect these low-lying areas as a whole.
Let me show you the topography of Singapore. This is a map of Singapore. The light green are the lowest areas. The dark green is a little bit higher. The brown are our hills, and the dark brown are our “mountains”! Not very much of it, so I do not think we can all retreat to live on Bukit Timah! Now let me show you the lowest parts, which are up to four metres above mean sea level. When sea levels rise, all these parts of Singapore will increasingly be at risk. Not underwater yet, but at risk like Chinatown used to be in the old days – high tide, rain, troubled. If you look carefully, there is a long stretch on the East Coast from Changi to the city. If you zoom in a little bit, you might be able to see where your house is. Not only will property values be affected, but safety and liveability also. And it will affect not only these particular areas, but the whole city. Because roads and trains run through the low-lying areas; hospitals, schools, and workplaces are all there. We cannot lose a big chunk of our city and expect the rest of Singapore to carry on as usual. Therefore, beyond localised measures, we need to protect entire areas, and the way to do that is to build coastal defences.
We have studied our whole coastline in detail, and we have divided it into different segments. Some are more vulnerable than others, and we need different strategies to protect each of them, and we will have to prioritise the work, starting with the more critical segments, and in particular, City-East Coast and also Jurong Island.
I will talk about the City – East Coast, which is a long stretch comprising the city area, and the eastern coastline. Let’s look at the city area first. We built the Marina Reservoir and Marina Barrage, to protect the city area from flooding. Many of us enjoy visiting the Marina Barrage, to picnic and fly kites on top of the Pump House, especially if we have little kids. But PUB did not build the Pump House for kite flying. Its real purpose is to house seven giant pumps. That is why it is so tall. When it rains heavily during high tide, these pumps pump water out of Marina Reservoir into the sea, so that rain falling in the city area can then drain into Marina Reservoir. When sea levels rise, one Pump House will not be enough. We will need to build a second pump house on the opposite end of the Barrage. PUB has planned for this.
So that’s for the city. For the eastern coastline, we will need possibly other solutions. We have looked at other countries for inspiration. In particular, we studied the Netherlands.
The word “Netherlands” itself means “low-lying lands”. Half of the country is at most 1 metre above sea level. In fact, one quarter (27%) of their land is actually below sea level, what the Dutch call “polders”. This is land that the Dutch have reclaimed from the sea. They first build a seawall in the water, enclose an area. Then they pump out the water behind the seawall to create dry land, and that dry land can be lower than sea level – and they have to keep pumping water out. The Dutch are famous for their windmills. But do you know why the Dutch originally built windmills? It was not to take tourist pictures. It was to pump water out from polders and keep the land dry. I do not think windmills will do very well in Singapore. The only windmill we had in Singapore was at Holland Village, and even that is gone now. But, polders are a serious option for us. We are building a small polder at Pulau Tekong, to gain some experience operating one. The new land will be used for SAF training.
Polders are one option to protect our eastern coastline. Instead of just building a seawall along the coastline, you extend out with a polder, build a seawall further out, you not only protect existing low-lying areas. But you extend out and create more land reclaimed from the sea which we can use for housing and other valuable purposes. That is one possible solution for the East Coast, to build polders along the coastline.
But there are other alternatives. For example, we could reclaim a series of islands offshore, from Marina East all the way to Changi. We join up the islands, connect them up with barrages, and create a freshwater reservoir, which will be similar to Marina Reservoir. This solution will make PUB very happy because we will have another big reservoir and it will enhance our water resilience. Our four taps will become more reliable.
What I showed you are just artists’ impressions, just to give you a sense of the possibilities. We have not done engineering drawings yet. We will examine all the options carefully, and when the time comes, we will decide what is the best way to do it. This problem has good engineering solutions, although they will all cost money. How much will it cost, to protect ourselves against rising sea levels? My guess is probably $100 billion over 100 years, quite possibly more. If we only have 10 years to solve the problem, we will not have enough time or resources to do it. But because this is a 50 to 100-year problem, we can implement a 50 to 100-year solution to this problem. In Singapore, for long-term problems, we can make long-term solutions. Not everywhere, but in Singapore, yes, we can.
We should treat climate change defences like we treat the SAF – with utmost seriousness.PM Lee Hsien Loong

PM Lee Hsien Loong
We should treat climate change defences like we treat the SAF – with utmost seriousness. Work steadily at it, maintain a stable budget year after year, keep your eye on the target and do it over many years and several generations. That way we can afford it, and when we need it, we will have it ready. Both the SAF and climate change defences are existential for Singapore. These are life and death matters. Everything else must bend at the knee to safeguard the existence of our island nation. There is one difference between the two. With the SAF, we hope never to go to war. If you have a strong SAF, you may deter threats and avoid having to go to war. But with climate change, we know for sure sea levels will rise. The only uncertainty is whether they rise a few decades earlier, or a few decades later. Therefore, we will implement our climate change plans progressively, and keep them flexible. But we must start now and sustain the effort, as the Dutch have done over the centuries, and as we have done with the SAF.
We must make this effort. Otherwise one day, our children and grandchildren will be ashamed of what our generation did not do.
Beyond protecting ourselves from rising seas, we also have long-term plans to remake and take full advantage of our coastline. One of these plans is the Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW). I first spoke about this in the 2013 Rally. Since then we have worked out more definite ideas. Let me first sketch out the overall shape. The GSW comprises 30km of our southern coastline, from the Gardens by the Bay East, all the way to Pasir Panjang. It contains 2,000 hectares of land: six times the size of Marina Bay and in our terms, double the size of Punggol.
The GSW includes the PSA city terminals at Tanjong Pagar, Keppel, and Brani. And it also includes the Pasir Panjang Terminals too. By 2027, the city terminals will move to Tuas. Later on, in 2040, the Pasir Panjang Terminal will also go to Tuas Port. This will free up prime land for re-development. It will be an opportunity to reshape the GSW into a new place to live, work and play.
Let me start with “live”. Here is Keppel Club. It is a golf course. It is close to two MRT stations, and Labrador Nature Reserve. The lease is expiring in two years’ time, so this will be one of the first GSW developments. There is enough land here to build 9,000 housing units – HDB and private housing with waterfront promenades, with greenery, and open spaces. And that is just the start, because there is space and land for public and private housing elsewhere in the GSW too. With GSW the size of two Punggols, you get a sense of the possibilities. Think of it as Punggol by the Bay.
Next, I go on to ""work” – the commercial areas. Several big companies already have offices near Labrador Park. Such as Google, Cisco and Unilever. We will develop more office space in the GSW, like this one, which is Mapletree Business City, will bring in more jobs. People can work near where they live, and live near where they work. This will create life and activity both during the day and at night.
Finally, I come to “play” – the fun part. There are many possibilities for fun and recreation. We will start by redeveloping the two old power stations in Pasir Panjang. These are the Pasir Panjang power stations. They used to supply electricity back in the 1960s, but were decommissioned long ago. We can find creative new uses for them. Just like how we made St James Power Station, near Vivo City, into a nightlife destination. Next, after Brani Terminal moves out, we can develop Pulau Brani together with Sentosa. We will build new attractions on Brani, just like we have Universal Studios on Sentosa. We will also revitalise Sentosa’s beach areas and expand its nature and heritage trails, to keep its island character. We will also link up the GSW with all the surrounding green areas, so that you have a whole connection from West Coast Park to East Coast Park, and also connect up the Rail Corridor and Sentosa. With a new green heart in the centre, Singapore will be even more of a City in a Garden.
I have already received one special request. When we discussed these plans at Cabinet, Ng Chee Meng put his hand up, and said: “NTUC is very grateful to the Government for Downtown East. How about a Downtown South?” I said, ok, we will do that. We will set aside land for the Labour Movement to build a resort, probably on Pulau Brani. We will make this gesture, to thank our workers for all their contributions to the nation. Because Singapore is for all of us.
Our city today comprises multiple layers and the imprints of different eras. The Greater Southern Waterfront will add yet more layers to the city.
Over the centuries, people have come to Singapore from different lands. Bringing with them their identities, cultures and beliefs. Their hopes and dreams, their passions and aspirations. Slowly, they wove these strands together to become Singaporeans and to build today’s Singapore.
The layout and architecture of our city reflects this richness and complexity. Faint traces of ancient Singapore survive, even today. In the 14th century, there were settlements at the mouth of the Singapore River, and near Bukit Larangan, known as Fort Canning Hill. Soon after the British arrived in 1819, they made a map of Singapore. It is a very interesting map. Let me orientate you. This is the Singapore River. Here is the Padang. This is Fort Canning Hill. The map shows a long feature, running from Fort Canning all the way to the Padang, which it described as “the historical lines of Singapore”. This was an ancient defensive line, an earth wall, dating back hundreds of years. Running along this earth wall was a stream. That stream became today’s Stamford Canal. The wall itself is gone, but Stamford Road follows the line of that wall. So today, when you walk along Stamford Road, you are walking along the ancient wall of Singapura. There is history there.
Parts of our Civic District and Central Business District are still laid out according to the first town plan that Raffles and his team drew up, 200 years ago. Many of the colonial buildings remain, often restored and repurposed, so the former Supreme Court and City Hall have become the National Gallery Singapore. Over two centuries, we have built and rebuilt generations of buildings. Today, we have created a distinctive city skyline, and a vibrant waterfront all round Marina Bay.
When we first reclaimed Marina East, Central and South 40 years ago, they were empty – a blank slate. For some years, we left the new land fallow. Definite plans only came later, as we developed a clearer sense of what the city needed, and began putting the building blocks in place. Now a new downtown is taking shape in Marina South, anchored around Marina Bay Financial Centre and Marina Bay Sands. Marina Bay is still far from fully developed. Meanwhile, we are already looking ahead, for our next major move.
Our modern port dates back to Raffles, who recognised Singapore’s qualities as a natural harbour. Nearly 50 years ago, we converted the wharves at Tanjong Pagar into our first container terminal. In 1991, as Tanjong Pagar reached its limits, we made a major decision: to reclaim land at Pasir Panjang to build a new container terminal. At that time, PSA was handling six million containers a year – they call them TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units). But PSA had audacious plans: to build a port to handle six times that number, 36 million TEUs.
Building Pasir Panjang Terminal was a considerable act of faith. But we backed PSA up, and PSA delivered: last year, it handled 36 million TEUs and more! Now we are making yet another leap, building Tuas Port, where PSA can double its volumes.
When PSA moves out of the city and Pasir Panjang terminals, these old spaces will once again be vacant – another blank slate. A new generation will have another opportunity to imagine and to build here some part of their vision for Singapore. I hope they will remember to place a marker somewhere, to remind themselves that PSA used to be there, and that it was the same daring and ambition, the same drive for excellence and determination to prevail, that made PSA a success and will make the GSW a reality.
Over the years, I have talked about many major projects at National Day Rallies. These are all progressively taking shape. In 2013, I described Jewel at Changi Airport. At that time, Jewel was just a concept and an ambition. Now we have completed it, on time and within budget. Kudos to the Changi team! Singapore has a spectacular new gateway to the world. Many of you have visited it, and we are all rightly very proud of it.
What we talk about, this Government, we will deliver.PM Lee Hsien Loong

PM Lee Hsien Loong
What we talk about, this Government, we will deliver. In the same way, we are realising our other ambitious plans. Punggol Digital District, Jurong Lake District, Changi Terminal 5, redevelopment of Paya Lebar Airbase, Tuas Port, and of course the Greater Southern Waterfront.
All these will not be done in a decade, or even in one generation. There will be space for successive generations to fill with their hopes and dreams. Each new generation will leave their mark on our city, as their predecessors have done.
This Bicentennial year, as we commemorate our history and progress, we also commit ourselves to improve on what we have, and build a better Singapore for our children. All this depends on Singaporeans remaining one united people, and having an honest and capable government working together with you, for you, for Singapore.
The next few years will be very demanding. We have to hand over smoothly to a new generation of leaders, and continue to strive to realise our ambitions. My team will work with you to build this jewel of a nation, so that Singapore will always be a vibrant, thriving city where opportunities are open to all, and our children and their children will have a bright future.
Let us strive together to create this future. Let us unite as one nation to build tomorrow’s Singapore.
Thank you and good night.

   singaporewebsite update april",9188,"In his speech, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong highlighted several key initiatives and developments shaping the future of Singapore. Celebrating the Bicentennial, he reflected on Singapore's rich history and its transformation over two centuries. The speech outlined major plans in education, workforce development, and climate change mitigation.

1. **Education and Youth Opportunities**: The government has significantly invested in early childhood education, doubling full-day preschool capacity and enhancing the quality of preschools through infrastructure improvements and teacher training programs. The National Institute of Early Childhood Development (NIEC) was established to upgrade training for preschool teachers. Additionally, subsidies for preschool education will be increased, making it more affordable for families.

2. **Workforce Development**: PM Lee discussed supporting older workers by encouraging continuous learning and job redesign to accommodate their needs. The government plans to raise the retirement and re-employment ages to 65 and 70 respectively by 2030, alongside increasing CPF contributions for older workers.

3. **Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability**: Addressing climate change, PM Lee announced plans to invest significantly in infrastructure to protect against rising sea levels, with potential solutions like polders and higher coastal barriers. He emphasized the importance of understanding, mitigating, and adapting to climate change, drawing parallels with national defense in terms of strategic importance.

4. **Urban Development**: The Greater Southern Waterfront (GSW) project was highlighted as a major redevelopment initiative that will transform the southern coastline into a new place to live, work, and play. This includes relocating port activities from Tanjong Pagar to Tuas to free up land for public and private housing, commercial spaces, and recreational areas.

5. **National Unity and Governance**: PM Lee stressed the importance of unity and a capable government to realize Singapore's ambitions. He reassured that the government's plans are long-term, aiming to provide opportunities for future generations and ensure a sustainable and prosperous future for all Singaporeans.

These initiatives reflect Singapore's proactive approach to education reform, workforce adaptation, environmental challenges, and urban redevelopment, underpinned by a commitment to inclusivity and long-term planning."

My fellow Singaporeans,
Every year, rain or shine, Singaporeans come together on the 9th of August for the National Day Parade, to celebrate the making of our nation, and renew our commitment to Singapore.
I have been privileged to attend almost every NDP since the first in 1966. One of the Parades I took part in was in 1968 at the Padang. The rain poured down, but the contingents stood steady, and marched past proudly, drenched, yet undaunted. We showed ourselves and the world that Singaporeans were rugged people, and had the steel in us to stand firm in adversity. Five years ago, SG50 was another memorable Parade. We celebrated our Golden Jubilee, and what we had achieved in Singapore. We also paid tribute to our founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew. We mourned his passing that year, but also affirmed what he and the pioneer leaders stood for.
In good years, our parades rejoice in our progress, and look forward to a better future together.
In difficult years, we still hold National Day Parades, to renew our resolve to weather the storm and take Singapore through to better days.
This year, National Day falls amidst COVID-19. We are not able to celebrate in our usual way, but we are determined still to hold the Parade as a symbol of our unity as a nation, like we have done every year since independence. We will have a smaller Parade at the Padang, and also ceremonies at seven other locations around the island this morning. Each location will symbolise one aspect of our response to COVID-19 – Providing medical care for Singaporeans at NCID; supporting our workforce with skills and jobs at the Lifelong Learning Institute; keeping learning going for our students at North Vista Secondary School; or sustaining our community spirit at Kampung Admiralty. We look forward to Singaporeans across the island, and also in far-flung lands, joining the Parade virtually and celebrating with one another. We will all share special moments like when the Red Lions land, the mobile column reaches our town, or the State Flag is flown past. We will all recite the Pledge and sing Majulah Singapura in our hearts together.
This NDP is also an opportunity for us to salute those on our frontline, fighting COVID-19.
Many of them have gone way beyond the call of duty, and shown great generosity of spirit. Retired doctors and nurses volunteered to come back, donning PPE to serve on the front lines, in hospitals and migrant worker dormitories. Full-time national servicemen extended their terms to continue supporting COVID-19 operations. Public officers volunteered to be redeployed to organise and look after the migrant workers. Many Singaporeans stepped up to help others in need. Some went door to door distributing meals and groceries to the elderly and low-income households. Others refurbished donated laptops for needy students, for home-based learning. Thousands of public-spirited Singaporeans volunteered to be trained for swab operations. They served in the hot zones, including the dormitories and community care facilities. Migrant workers too played their part to support these operations. Their help was deeply appreciated by our SAF, Home Team and public officers.
These selfless acts have made all the difference to our response to COVID-19.
We will need this unity and resilience more than ever. The crisis is far from over. Many countries brought COVID-19 under control and eased restrictions, only to see their cases rise sharply again. This can happen to us too, despite all our precautions. It will most likely take a year or two before a vaccine is widely available, and the threat of the virus is blunted. Until then, we have to maintain our vigilance and resolve, to keep ourselves, our loved ones and our neighbours all safe.
We also need to be resilient in the face of the severe economic downturn. Singaporeans are understandably anxious and worried. Business closures, retrenchments and unemployment are all likely to go up in the coming months.
But this is not the first economic crisis we have experienced. Just in the last quarter century, we have seen the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998), the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks (2001), and the Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009). Each time the outlook was ominous, and we feared the worst, but each time we worked hard to secure our position, gritted our teeth, and came through together.
I am confident we will get through this current crisis too, though it may take longer. All of us must do our part, but none of us will be alone. The government is actively helping people find new jobs and acquire new skills. We also have the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and Self-employed person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to ease the burden on employers and individuals. The Labour Movement is working with employers to create job training programmes and career pathways. It will also ensure that every worker is treated fairly and with dignity, especially when job losses cannot be avoided. Employers too must make every effort to keep their workers, and not drop them at the first sign of trouble. This will build loyalty, and encourage the employees to help their employers rebuild when conditions improve.
Our experience fighting COVID-19, grim and hard as it has been, has brought us closer together. The shared ordeal will toughen a whole population, and bond us together as one united people. Just like how the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations were tempered by Separation and Independence, and economic crises in our early years as a nation.
Let us brace ourselves for the trials ahead, so that many years from now, when our grandchildren celebrate National Day, they will look back on these times and say yes, this generation stood together, sacrificed for one another, and built Singapore for us.
Every National Day, we remind ourselves that Singapore is a nation whose story is worth celebrating, whose history is worth cherishing, and whose future is worth building.
When we hold the National Day Parade at the Padang, or at the Float@Marina Bay, the audience can see the Marina Bay skyline in the background. Marina Bay used to be open sea, but we reclaimed the land around it, turned the ocean into a reservoir, and progressively built on the new land, to create an outstanding and vibrant downtown. Looking out across the Bay, you can immediately see how far Singapore has come, and imagine the possibility and promise that Singapore holds.
Today, when National Service recruits complete their Basic Military Training (BMT), they gather their families and friends at the Float and hold their passing out parade there. It helps them to understand what they are defending, and why generations of national servicemen have been willing to serve and sacrifice, to defend this metropolis that we have built together, and also the society that created all this: Our families. Our friends. Our lives. Our future.
Three years ago, I announced that we would rebuild the Float into a permanent space to commemorate National Service, and the central role that NS plays in Singapore, and that we would name this space, NS Square. The design contract has been awarded. This is how it will look like. The development will be aligned on a central axis, with The Promontory on the opposite side of the Bay. The platform will become a red dot, shining bright in our city. NS Square will be the central focus of our new downtown. We will build a gallery there to showcase our National Service story, and honour the contributions of national servicemen past and present. NS Square will also be a community space for everyone, young and old, to enjoy. And of course, we will continue to hold our National Day Parades there.
This National Day, as we celebrate across the island, we will be saying the Pledge and singing Majulah Singapura in unison – not aloud as usual because of COVID- 19, but in our hearts, with more feeling than ever.
We have dreams to realise, and goals to reach for. Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.
I wish everyone a very happy National Day!
We have dreams to realise, and goals to reach for. Let us show the world that whatever the challenges, Singaporeans will stay united, and prevail once more.PM Lee Hsien Loong

   singaporewebsite update april",1470,"In his National Day speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore addressed the nation amidst the challenges posed by COVID-19, emphasizing the resilience and unity of Singaporeans. Despite the pandemic, the traditional National Day Parade (NDP) was adapted to include smaller ceremonies across various locations, each symbolizing different aspects of Singapore's response to the crisis, such as healthcare, workforce support, and community spirit. These decentralized celebrations allowed for virtual participation, ensuring that the spirit of the NDP remained intact.

PM Lee highlighted the extraordinary contributions of frontline workers, volunteers, and the community in combating the pandemic. He praised retired healthcare professionals, full-time national servicemen, public officers, and ordinary citizens who stepped up to support the nation during these unprecedented times.

Looking ahead, PM Lee acknowledged the severe economic downturn and the likelihood of increased business closures, retrenchments, and unemployment. He reassured that the government is actively assisting with job placements and skills training through initiatives like the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and the Self-employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). He also emphasized the importance of solidarity and collective effort in overcoming the crisis, drawing parallels with past crises that Singapore has successfully navigated.

Furthermore, PM Lee announced the redevelopment of the Float@Marina Bay into NS Square, a permanent space to honor national servicemen and serve as a community hub, symbolizing the ongoing commitment to national defense and community cohesion.

In conclusion, PM Lee called on Singaporeans to remain united and resilient, echoing the nation's history of overcoming adversity and continuing to build a promising future for the next generations."

My fellow Singaporeans
Good evening again
My last National Day Rally was two years ago.
Since then, COVID-19 has changed our world. Globally, it has taken millions of lives, sickened many more and disrupted countless jobs and businesses. In Singapore, each time it looks like we have beaten the virus, it breaks through in a different place and forces us to tighten up again.
But we have done better than many countries. We have kept our people safe and protected our livelihoods. I thank you all for your trust and cooperation. Your discipline and resilience have made all the difference in the fight against COVID-19.
I want to especially thank all those on the frontline, Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans, who have fought so hard, for so long. Some of you are here at the Rally. Others are joining us virtually. Welcome again and thank you all!
Many of you have gone beyond the call of duty. Like Aisha Abdul Rahman, a passenger service agent at Changi Airport. After passenger flights were sharply cut, Aisha was redeployed as a cargo agent for cold chain logistics. She learnt to operate a forklift, and now handles temperature-sensitive goods, including vaccines. Roslina Toh is a student volunteer. In March last year, when Malaysia closed its borders, many Malaysian workers were stranded here. Roslina marshalled a team of 200 volunteers, to organise food and shelter for them. Priyaa Mohena is a senior physiotherapist at Woodlands Health. She has expertise in respiratory problems, lung problems. So she was deployed to look after COVID-19 patients. I met her recently and asked her – how did you feel? Were you afraid? She said. “I was not afraid. I am proud to give back. I am proud to be Singaporean”.
There are many more like Aisha, Roslina and Priyaa – contact tracers, swabbers, ambulance drivers, workers running quarantine facilities and vaccination centres. Because of people like them, we held together in the face of COVID-19 and brought the situation under control. Thank you all!
Our vaccination programme has been very successful. Singaporeans came forward readily to get jabbed, confident that they would be in safe hands, including Mdm Chew Huat Mui. She is 92 years old. Here, she is getting her jab, not just from any nurse, but from her daughter Alice.
Now, 8 in 10 residents are fully vaccinated. We are in a new situation. Vaccination has slowed the transmission and spread of COVID-19. But the virus has also mutated. The Delta variant is much more infectious. It is no longer possible to bring COVID-19 cases down to zero, even if we lock down for a long time. Therefore, we must prepare for COVID-19 to become endemic, like the flu or chicken pox. Fortunately, with vaccination and added precautions, we can live with the virus and become “COVID resilient”. We may have to tap on the brakes from time to time, but we want to avoid having to slam on the brakes hard. So in the next phase, we will move step by step. Not in one big bang like in some countries but cautiously and progressively, feeling our way forward.
Over the last week, the number of COVID-19 cases has gone up. But the number of seriously ill has remained stable. It is important to maintain this, so that we can continue to ease up, and especially to reconnect Singapore with the rest of the world.
Meanwhile, we continue to make every effort to reach the remaining unvaccinated population. We are trying to reach you before the virus reaches you. With endemic COVID-19, sooner or later everyone will meet the virus. If you are vaccinated, you may not get infected. But if you are not vaccinated, you will almost certainly get infected, and may well become very sick. For children, COVID-19 is often a mild disease. But for the old and not vaccinated, it can be very dangerous. That is why mobile vaccination clinics are going around HDB neighbourhoods so people upstairs can come down for their vaccinations and volunteer teams are going house to house, a doctor and a nurse, to vaccinate those who are immobile at home, one by one.
If we all do our part in the months ahead, then we can keep our situation stable, and gradually return to a more normal life. Go back to work or school, meet family and friends, gather for religious services, celebrate birthdays and weddings, watch live shows and sports events and come together for National Day!
With COVID-19 under control, we must now refocus on the future.
Singapore has survived its worst economic crisis since independence. We drew on every available resource, to support workers and companies and emerge stronger.
Now, we must change gears. It is no longer about drawing down reserves to keep ourselves on life support. It is about generating new growth, new jobs, and prosperity for the future.
The global economy is picking up. The US and China are growing strongly. Europe is also recovering. These are our major markets. That is why MTI is more confident that Singapore will also do well and has raised our growth forecast to 6% to 7%.
Beyond this year, to sustain longer term growth, we need to do three things: Preserve our status as a business hub, attract more foreign investments and grow Singapore companies and entrepreneurs.
First, we must preserve Singapore’s status as a business hub. Many MNCs use Singapore as their regional base. Their staff, both local and foreign, need to fly in and out of Singapore to visit operations in other countries. So too do our own businessmen. If our borders stay closed for too long. MNCs will find us less useful. Singaporean businesses also will suffer and our economy will be permanently damaged. So it is important for us to open up soon and allow more people to travel in and out of Singapore, in a safe way.
Second, Singapore must remain attractive to investors. Even during the pandemic, EDB persuaded major companies to invest here. You have heard of Pfizer, the company that makes the vaccine, Pfizer has been in Singapore for a long time. Now, BioNTech, Pfizer’s vaccine partner, will also be setting up shop here. GlobalFoundries is a semiconductor manufacturer. It already has five wafer fabs here and now it is building its sixth one. Two years ago, I did not know what Zoom was. Zoom has opened a new R&D centre, their first in Southeast Asia. EDB has more projects in its pipeline. All these investments will create many good jobs for Singaporeans.
Third, Singapore companies must make their mark in the new economy. A few have become global names, like Carro, SecretLab, and Carousell. Enterprise Singapore is supporting more entrepreneurs to follow in their footsteps, go out into the world, seize new opportunities and grow their businesses.
Yvon Bock founded Hegen, a company selling baby-feeding bottles and equipment
It is a tough business to be in, because Singaporeans are making too few babies. So from the start, Yvon expanded into other markets. Hegen products are popular in China, Korea, and even Israel. When COVID-19 hit, many of Hegen’s physical retail channels shut down, so Yvon shifted to marketing online. She improved her websites, conducted livestreams in multiple languages, and hired more staff to fulfil orders. Now Hegen’s main engine of growth is online sales.
The government will create the conditions for entrepreneurs like Yvon to start and grow their companies. But subsidies and grants only go so far. Ultimately, it is their own resolve and resourcefulness which will secure their success.
Economic growth is a means to an end, not an end in itself. It must be inclusive growth that benefits all Singaporeans, so that we can all fulfil our aspirations, and see our children live better lives than ourselves. This is how Singaporeans have been uplifted, generation after generation.
To keep this up, we have to tackle our social challenge, COVID-19 has sharpened fault lines in our society, and made some difficult issues more urgent. Tonight, I will talk about three of them. First, supporting lower-wage workers (LWWs). Second, addressing anxieties over foreign work pass holders. Third, managing race and religion.

Let me first talk about supporting LWWs. During COVID-19, many LWWs were on the frontline. Singaporeans saw the importance of jobs like cleaning, food delivery, and security. We gained fresh respect and appreciation for these workers.
LWWs and their families receive significant support from the Government. In housing, through HDB subsidies, rental flats. In healthcare, through hospital subsidies, the CHAS scheme, and MediFund. In retirement, through CPF top ups and Silver Support and in education, through a huge effort to support lower income families, to help their children do well in school and beyond.
Despite this, LWWs are more stressed than others. Their jobs are less secure. They are more likely to be laid off. They have less savings to tide over hard times. In the pandemic, their situation has been precarious. That is why in every COVID-19 Budget Package we included extra help to lower income households.
Beyond emergency assistance, LWWs need longer term support. In many countries, the earnings of such workers have stagnated. But in Singapore, the lives have improved as the country progress. Because the government has helped them upgrade their skills, use machines and technology, and become more productive. We also have specific policies to raise their income. One important policy is the Workfare Income Supplement (Workfare) Scheme. Workfare is effectively a negative income tax. Instead of taxing the incomes of LWWs, the Government tops up their salaries in cash and CPF contributions. Almost half a million workers benefit and it costs the Government $850m a year . In two years’ time, we will increase this to $1.1b. This allows us to raise payouts for all Workfare recipients and to help younger LWWs, by starting Workfare younger, from age 30 rather than 35.
Another key policy is the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). The PWM now covers cleaners, security guards, landscaping workers and lift maintenance workers. It has raised their skills and productivity, and boosted their incomes and job progression.
Today, with Progressive Wages, every cleaner earns at least $1,200. In two years’ time, they will earn at least $1,500. After another two years, this will go up further, to at least $1,900. By then, the cleaners would also have picked up new skills and become more productive. The story is similar for security guards, landscaping workers and lift maintenance workers.
SMS Zaqy Mohamad chairs a Tripartite Workgroup studying how we can help LWWs more. The Workgroup has recommended three strategies to uplift LWWs.
One, to extend Progressive Wages to many more workers. We will cover more sectors, starting with retail next year, and later food services and waste management. We will also cover specific occupations, across all sectors simultaneously, starting with administrative assistants and drivers. In other words, at some point, sector by sector, horizontal. Slicing vertically, across all sector at once.
Second, we will require companies hiring foreign workers to pay all their local employees at least a Local Qualifying Salary. Today, these companies already have to pay this Qualifying Salary ($1,400) to some of their local employees, depending on how many work permits or s-passes they require. We will tighten this to require these companies to payalltheir local employees this Local Qualifying Salary if they wish to hire any foreign employees and this Local Qualifying Salary will also be adjusted from time to time.
Three, to introduce a PW Mark – Progressive Wage Mark. We will accredit companies that are paying all their workers Progressive Wages with the PW Mark. We don’t have an official logo yet, but I asked Nanyang Polytechnic students, to design something for the Workgroup to consider and this is what they have come up with. The PW Mark will tell consumers which companies are paying all their workers decent wages. The public sector is a major buyer of goods and services. It will take the lead, and purchase only from such businesses.
The Government accepts the Workgroup’s recommendations. The extended Progressive Wages plus the tighter Local Qualifying Salary will cover 8 in 10 LWWs. If we include the Workfare enhancements, almost all LWWs can look forward to higher incomes within the next two years.
The Workgroup has done its best to understand the aspirations of workers, the concerns of employers, and the objectives of the government. I met them virtually on Monday to thank them. Their proposals are a tripartite consensus, carefully negotiated and balanced between all stakeholders.
The cost of higher wages for the LWWs will have to be shared. Workers have to reskill and become more productive. Employers have to absorb part of the additional wage costs. The Government will help them with transitional support but businesses will still have to pass on some of the costs to their customers .
So all of us, as consumers, must also chip in. Pay a little bit more for some of our favourite things, like bubble tea or bak chor mee to help the shop cover higher cleaning and waste collection costs.
I am glad that many Singaporeans are willing to support LWWs in this way. It will not only enable the workers to keep their jobs at higher pay. It will also show that as a society, we value their work and contributions, and that they are part of us.
I am especially concerned about a specific group of LWWs. These are the delivery workers. They work with online platforms, like Food Panda, Grab or Deliveroo. They are a familiar sight, especially during COVID-19, delivering our orders day and night. It is hard work, and most earn modest incomes.
Let me show you a clip from a short film by Mohammad Ruzhael bin Marwazi. Ruzhael is a talented second year student at ITE Central studying film. He made this prize-winning film based on his own experience as a delivery worker. Let’s watch it.
“Kejar” – it means to chase, in Malay. This film captures the pressures on delivery workers, chasing the target and earning their daily keep. Under constant stress for reasons beyond their control: bad weather, scary dogs, motorcycle breakdowns, trying their best to hit their daily targets, and not always succeeding.
Delivery workers, are for all intents and purposes, just like employees. The online platforms set the price of their product. They determine which jobs are assigned to which workers. They manage how the workers perform, including imposing penalties and suspensions.
Yet delivery workers have no employment contracts with the online platforms. Therefore they lack the basic job protection that most employees enjoy, like workplace injury compensation, union representation and employer CPF. Besides delivery workers, there are also some LWWs in other jobs who have an employee-like relationship with platforms. They too will find it harder to afford housing, healthcare and eventually, retirement.
More people are taking up this type of work, so this problem is growing. MOM is studying it and will be doing consultations. We must address the issues to give these workers more secure futures.
LWWs are not the only ones feeling job anxiety. Middle income Singaporeans are also feeling the pressure. We see this in the growing restlessness over foreigners, particularly work pass holders. This unhappiness was already present before COVID-19, but the economic uncertainty has intensified it.
Work pass holders are here to complement our workforce and grow the economy. In good times, this attracts investments, which in turn creates more jobs for locals. In bad times, like last year, the foreign workforce shrinks, and this shields locals from worse job losses.
Most Singaporeans understand these economic arguments. But there is another set of arguments based on individual lived experiences, which are more personal and emotional. It is about competition for jobs and opportunities at the workplace. Is my employer hiring work pass holders at my expense? Is he treating me fairly when it comes to postings and promotions? Is he developing and preparing me to take on bigger responsibilities? These are valid questions, which we must address.
First, we must assure Singaporeans that Employment Pass and S Pass holders are of the right standard. A practical and reasonable indication of quality is how much the employer is prepared to pay for the work pass holder. This is why to qualify for an EP or S Pass, there are salary cut-offs.
As Singaporean wages rise, we have raised these cut-offs in step. Last year, we raised the cut-offs twice. For the financial sector, where salaries are higher, we set a higher cut-off.
We will continue to tighten the criteria for EP and S passes over time. Not suddenly or sharply, which would hurt businesses, but gradually and progressively. This will ensure that work pass holders come in where we most need them. And we won’t be flooded with more than we can absorb, doing jobs for which Singaporeans are qualified and available. Second, we must assure all employees of fair treatment at the workplace. We often hear complaints about financial institutions and IT companies hiring too many foreigners. Both these sectors indeed have a large share of work pass holders.  This is because we are a business hub. The finance and IT companies here perform regional and global functions, which require both local and foreign talent and expertise. Plus, finance and IT are growing sectors, where the skills are in short supply not just in Singapore but in many countries. But these companies have also recruited many Singaporeans, and groomed the promising ones to take on senior and international positions not just in Singapore, but all over the region. Had we not allowed them to import the EPs they needed, the companies would not have come here, and Singaporeans would have had fewer opportunities
Of course, not every company plays ball. A few have not been fair employers. They hire from their own countries, using familiar links and old boys’ networks, rather than on merit. And they give foreigners the jobs and opportunities, and only make token gestures with locals. That naturally causes problems
Government agencies deal with these transgressions firmly. For example, when the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) receives a complaint about HR practices in a bank, it investigates thoroughly. If the complaint is valid, MAS will speak to the bank, at a senior level. When MAS raises an eyebrow, the banks take it very seriously.  They report back to their HQ, and make adjustments. When IMDA does the same with IT companies, they too take note. The interventions by our agencies are quiet, but effective. I once met a CEO in Davos. We said hello and chatted. On his own accord, he told me that his IT subsidiary in Singapore was doing its best to improve local recruitment and talent development, and to be a good corporate citizen. I knew why he said this and thanked him politely.  Later I cross-checked with IMDA, and was happy to confirm that the company had indeed made an effort and improved.
To deal with workplace discrimination more broadly, we have TAFEP – the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices.  TAFEP has laid out clear guidelines on fair treatment. Most companies comply. If a company falls short, TAFEP will counsel it and if it still fails to get its act together, MOM can impose administrative penalties, including restricting it from hiring foreign workers.
This has generally worked quite well. But over the years, the government has received repeated requests to toughen up TAFEP. In particular, the Labour Movement and NTUC MPs have pushed for anti-discrimination laws that carry penalties. The government has held back, because we did not want the process to become legalistic or confrontational.  It is better if disputes can be resolved amicably, through persuasion or mediation but after consulting the tripartite partners, we have decided to adopt the Labour MPs’ suggestions. We will enshrine the TAFEP guidelines in law. This will give them more teeth and expand the range of actions we can take. We will model our approach on how we deal with another class of disputes: those over salaries or wrongful dismissal. In such disputes, conciliation and mediation are tried first. Only when those fail, does the matter go before an Employment Claims Tribunal, which will arbitrate and decide the case. We will create a similar Tribunal to deal with workplace discrimination. This will protect workers against discrimination based on nationality whether you’re Singaporean or non-Singaporean. It will also prohibit other kinds of discrimination covered by TAFEP. Women will get better protection and discrimination based on age, race, religion, and disability will also be disallowed. Philosophically, writing TAFEP guidelines into the law is a major move. It signals that we do not tolerate discrimination at workplaces. But in practice, we hope to operate in a similar way as today, except better. We should still resolve workplace disputes informally and amicably, if at all possible.
The legal redress should be a last recourse but whose existence will cause the parties to work harder to settle the dispute, through conciliation and mediation.
While we deal with workplace issues arising from large numbers of work pass holders, we must also pay attention to their social impact. Work pass holders come here to work. Some stay on, eventually becoming PRs and naturalised citizens. But most do not stay long enough to integrate fully into our society.
Social frictions arise because culturally, work pass holders are different from us
Even if they are of Chinese, Malay or Indian race, they are different from us. In fact, sometimes frictions arise, precisely because they are racially similar to us
They look like us, yet they don’t act like us.
I once tried to explain our multi-racial society to a foreign leader.  I said, Singaporeans are racially similar to people from China, India, or Southeast Asia.  But after two generations of nation building, Chinese Singaporeans have become different from Chinese-Chinese, and Indian Singaporeans have become different from Indian-Indians, and so on. The foreign leader understood English but he looked at me, bewildered. Then he turned to his interpreter to ask, “What is this Chinese-Chinese and Indian-Indian?”. I tried to explain again. I said we have all become Singaporeans, more than we are Chinese, Malays or Indians. I am not sure he fully got it because his country did not have this problem. But Singaporeans will understand. Compared to the non-Singaporeans, we are “same same but different”
We need to ease the social frictions that arise from being “same same but different”. Both sides need to make the effort. Singaporeans must be open to living with and accepting others who are not exactly like us. Non-Singaporeans here must accept the ethos and norms of our society, and make the effort to fit in. For example, with our immigrant roots, Singapore is generally an egalitarian society.
But some work pass holders and their families bring with them social practices and class distinctions from their own countries.  These run counter to the informal and equal way Singapo­reans interact with one another, and that causes frictions.
Non-Singaporeans must understand how Singapore is, so that they can fit in better. Actually, most work pass holders and their families fit in quite well. After living here for some years, some speak Singlish, others enjoy sambal belachan, and even durian!
Quite a few have set up family or have children here. Like Kai Kai and Jia Jia, our two pandas at the River Safari. Their cub was born on the 7thDay of the 7thMonth, after the 7thtry. Made in Singapore!
Concerns over work pass holders are a very delicate subject for a National Day Rally but I decided I had to talk about it. We have to acknowledge the problem, so we can address Singaporeans’ legitimate concerns, and defuse resentments over foreigners. Only thus can Singapore remain open and continue to grow and progress.
The reality is that our competition is not only from foreigners who are physically here, we are competing with people who are all over the world in Europe, Canada, America, China and Australia. COVID-19 has taught many companies that “working from home” is just one step away from “working anywhere”. They and their staffs no longer need to be all in the same place. All they need is a good internet connection.
Foreigners who are here in Singapore strengthen our team. They are our colleagues, and our neighbours and friends. During COVID-19, some have endured personal hardships, perhaps separated from families who are abroad, or stuck outside Singapore and unable to return home here. Many worked on the front line, shoulder-to-shoulder with Singaporeans. They too have contributed to Singapore.
We must not turn our backs on them, and give the impression that Singapore is becoming xenophobic and hostile to foreigners. It would gravely damage our reputation as an international hub. It would cost us investments, jobs and opportunities. It would be disastrous for us and most of all, it is not who we aspire to be.
Instead, we must make it crystal clear to the world that Singapore is determined to stay open, in order to earn a living for ourselves. It is not just our policies which have to be outward and forward looking, but also our mindsets and values as a people, to look beyond our shores, to welcome ideas and talent and to accept competition and change. These values helped transform a population of immigrants into a cosmopolitan and vibrant country. We must uphold them, as we continue to build our home and nation.
It is not just our policies which have to be outward and forward looking, but also our mindsets and values as a people, to look beyond our shores, to welcome ideas and talent and to accept competition and change.PM Lee Hsien Loong

My third topic tonight is race and religion. During COVID-19, race relations have come under stress. There have been more racist incidents, several of which were widely publicised on social media. One happened just before National Day. Tanjong Pagar Town Council displayed banners to celebrate, featuring Singaporean families of different races. Unfortunately, netizens picked on one banner showing an Indian family, as though there were no other banners of other races. They made very nasty comments, accusing the government of being pro-foreigner and pro-Indian. Actually, the family is Singaporean, and the son, Thiruben, is a national athlete.
In another incident, a polytechnic lecturer, a Chinese Singaporean, accosted an interracial couple on Orchard Road. The woman was Thai-Chinese, and her partner was Indian-Filipino. Both were Singaporeans. The lecturer berated them, saying that they should date someone of their own races. He apologised later, but the damage was done. Several of these incidents have specifically targeted Indians, both work pass holders and citizens. One reason could be the large number of Indian work pass holders here. Another factor could be the Delta variant of COVID-19, which first emerged in India. I understand people are frustrated the Delta variant managed to get into Singapore. But it is illogical to blame this on Indians. Just as it is illogical to blame the Alpha variant on the English, the KTV cluster on Vietnamese, or the initial outbreak in Wuhan on the Chinese. We must address the real issues – manage the work pass numbers and concentrations, and improve border health safeguards. But we should not let our frustrations spill over to affect our racial harmony.
These racist incidents remind us how fragile our harmony is. But they do not negate our multi-racial approach, which has worked well for us. Racial harmony did not happen spontaneously in Singapore. It took hard work, sacrifice and wisdom. Our founding fathers resolved to forge one nation from the different races. They made multi-racial equality and harmony a fundamental principle of nation building. They did not suppress the distinct identities of each group. Instead they acknowledged and accommodated them. Everyone in Singapore could practise their own beliefs, festivals, religions, and cultures. English, not Chinese, became our working language, so that no race would be privileged over the others.
At the same time, we preserved the mother tongues. We retained Malay as our national language and continued singing Majulah Singapura with gusto in Malay. Over time, the different ethnic groups reached a balance. We did this not through push and shove, but through mutual compromise and give and take. No group got everything it wanted. Each gave up a little in order for all to live harmoniously side by side.
As a result, Singapore is one of the few countries in the world where people of different races and faiths live peacefully together and have done so now for more than half a century. It is a rare and precious achievement but it is also a delicate balance because a harmonious, multiracial country is not a natural or stable state of affairs. It does not happen by itself and it does not stay there by itself.
Look around the world. Many countries set out professing the same noble ideals
But over time, their race relations and politics polarise. Often, the majority group asserts its power and sidelines the minorities. The minorities find themselves with less and less space, and feel no choice but to push back hard. Sometimes, the minorities pursue aggressive identity politics  and the majority group feels pressured and threatened, and rallies around hardline chauvinist leaders. It happens to countries much older than Singapore. Either way, the outcome is unhappy, for both majority and minorities. And once a country has gone down that path, it is very difficult to turn back.
Fortunately, right from the beginning, Singapore chose a different path for ourselves.
Nevertheless, 56 years is a very short time in the history of nations. Our racial harmony is still work in progress, and will be so for a long time. We all take pride in Singapore’s multiracial identity but all of us still retain at least some racial or religious preferences. We make friends more easily with others who are of the same race, or share our own religion. We mostly choose life partners who are the same race, although that is changing. All this is human, and natural in every society.
But sometimes, it goes beyond racial and cultural preferences to become biases and prejudices. Then it is a problem. Some job advertisements require people who speak Chinese, yet it is not always clear whether this is a genuine necessity for the job or a polite way to signal that the employer is more comfortable with Chinese workers. Or you are looking to rent a flat, you call the property agent, he finds out you are not Chinese, then he says sorry, the owner doesn’t want to rent to you after all. If he is polite he stops there. If he is direct, he will tell you why.
These things do happen here. The minorities experience it more acutely, because they are the ones most affected by such racial discrimination. They feel angry, hurt, disappointed that the words in our National Pledge are still an aspiration, but still not fully achieved. I know it is harder to belong to a minority race than to the majority. This is true in every multi-racial society but it does not mean we have to accept this state of affairs in Singapore.
We must keep on working at it, to become one people, regardless of race, language or religion. The majority must be more sensitive to the concerns of the minorities and we must also have the moral courage to take a stand against racist behaviour. To express clear disapproval of racist incidents when they happen. That is not so hard but what is harder,  to call out deliberate racist agitation that masquerades as something else. Like the campaign against CECA, which claimed to be about putting Singaporeans first, but had a strong racial undertone.
The real solution to racism is to change social attitudes. Individual and social attitude, This takes time and effort. Legislation can play a role. Laws may not by themselves make people get along with one another or like one another. But laws can signal what our society considers right or wrong, and nudge people over time to behave better.
Today, we have various laws dealing with serious racial offences, like hate crime or causing racial enmity but these laws are scattered in different places, like the Penal Code and the Sedition Act and they focus purely on crimes and punishments, rather than persuasion and rehabilitation.
We intend to pass specific legislation on Racial Harmony. We will call it The Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act. It will collect together in one place all the Government’s powers to deal with racial issues. It will also incorporate some softer, gentler touches. For example, the power to order someone who has caused offence to stop doing it, and to make amends by learning more about the other race and mending ties with them. This softer approach will heal hurt, instead of leaving resentment and if he complies and does it, that is good and we will move on. If he does not comply or continues to do wrong things, of course legal consequences follow.
We already have a similar law for religious harmony - The Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. We have never needed to invoke any of the punishments under this Act but just the existence of the law has had a salutary effect. It has helped to restrain intolerance and promote religious harmony. Similarly, a Maintenance of Racial Harmony Act will encourage moderation and tolerance between different racial groups. It will signal the overriding importance of racial harmony to Singapore.
Besides pushing against discrimination and racist attitudes, we also need to keep our policies on race and religion up to date because racial and religious harmony is not just delicate, but also dynamic. It changes over time. Our values and beliefs as a society shift over time. Each new generation has its own perspective on racial issues.
Older Singaporeans lived through Singapore’s independence journey. They think: discussions can become disputes, disputes can become quarrels, better don’t talk about such things too much. Younger Singaporeans did not personally experience the racial tensions and riots of our early years. Their lived experience has been largely racial peace and harmony. They believe we are mature and stable now. We want to improve the status quo. We must talk about racial and religious issues more openly and relook our policies and assumptions afresh. These generational differences in views are perfectly understandable and should be accommodated. That is within Singapore.
Meanwhile, the world around us is changing. Singapore is highly exposed to external political developments. We are moved by the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, or the violence between Israel and the Palestinians in Gaza. Our own circumstances and context are completely different, and these are not our quarrels but they do affect our people.
We are influenced by external religious trends too. Many Christians think of themselves as members of a worldwide communion. Similarly, Muslims consider themselves to belong to a global ummah. So when religious norms elsewhere shift, norms and practices in Singapore are also affected.
Therefore, from time to time, we must adjust our policies on race and religion. But we should adjust based on our own needs and circumstances, and not just because of trends abroad and we should do so with caution, because race and religion will always be highly sensitive issues. We have to take the time to discuss respectfully, make sure everybody understands, and build a consensus before we make any move.
One example of how we do this is the tudung issue. Wearing the tudung has become increasingly important for the Muslim community. It reflects a general trend of stronger religiosity in Islam, around the world, in Southeast Asia, and in Singapore. For many Muslim women, it has become an important part of their faith, and an expression of a deeply felt identity.
Over the last few decades, more Muslim women in Singapore have worn the tudung, both in social settings and workplaces. Year to year, the change is gradual but over a generation, the shift is quite obvious. The government fully understands the desire of more Muslim women to wear the tudung but we are cautious about how non-Muslims will react to the visible change, and how that could affect relations between the communities. Will it be seen as more “inclusive”, or will it highlight and accentuate differences?
Today, the tudung is commonly worn in most settings without restriction – in public places. In workplaces, in Parliament, attending the National Day Rally. However, in some places where uniforms are required, the government has not allowed the tudung to be worn. This particularly applies to school uniforms, to uniforms in the SAF and Home Team, and also to nurses’ uniforms in public hospitals.
Generally, the Muslim community has understood and accepted the government’s stance on the tudung. But they still hope that over time, things can change. In particular, allowing nurses to wear the tudung has become a focal issue for Muslims here.
In 2014, when there was intense discussion on the tudung, I had a closed-door meeting with Muslim leaders . We spoke candidly, heart to heart. They explained to me why the tudung was important to the community, and what they hoped the Government would allow. I told them I understood how strongly they felt, but I also explained the Government’s perspective, and the reasons behind our policies.
I said that for school uniforms, the Government had overriding reasons for the current rules. In national schools, all students wear the same uniforms whether they are rich or poor, and regardless of race or religion. We need to emphasise their similarities and minimise their differences so that students can build bonds in their formative years that will shape their attitudes for life.
For different important reasons, we must maintain the status quo for the SAF, Home Team and other uniformed services. They are impartial and secular arms of the State. They wield armed force, and enforce the laws of Singapore. They must always be seen to be doing so without fear or favour. Therefore, everyone wears the same uniform
Then, we have the nurses in hospitals. Here, the opposing considerations are more finely balanced. On the one hand the community’s desires. on the other hand the government’s concerns, both national and specific. Patients in a hospital are often anxious, and sometimes very ill. So it is important that they see all nurses as the same. On their part, nurses must feel equally comfortable caring for all patients, regardless of race or religion. We don’t want a visible distinction in the nurses’ attire to make this harder to achieve.
I told the Muslim leaders in 2014 that government policy in the health­care sector was not set in stone. We would monitor the situation. If and when we changed our position, we would first make sure that everyone – Muslims and non-Muslims – understood and accepted the change because the tudung is not just a matter for Muslims. It is a national issue.
Since then, the government has been watching the situation closely. We observed that by and large, interactions between the races remain comfortable. Non-Muslims have become more used to seeing Muslim women wear the tudung. Muslim women wearing tudung are generally also quite at ease interacting socially with non-Muslim men and women, in most settings. Specifically in hospitals, some of the non-uniformed staff do wear the tudung, and we saw that their relationship with patients and colleagues was alright. Furthermore, younger Singaporeans are more accepting of racial and religious differences.
So a few months ago, I met Muslim leaders again. I thanked them for their help managing this sensitive issue all these years. I told them we were now ready. We would prepare the ground and tee up for a decision by the National Day Rally.
So tonight, I am making the announcement. Starting in November, Muslim nurses in the public healthcare sector will be allowed to wear a tudung with their uniforms, if they wish to.
I spoke about this in the Malay speech earlier, but did not make the announcement then. So let me announce it again in Malay, for our Malay friends.
Biar saya ucapkan sekali lagi dalam Bahasa Melayu buat rakan-rakan Melayu kita.
Pemerintah telah ambil keputusan mengenai soal tudung. Mulai November nanti, jururawat Muslim di sektor kesihatan awam akan dibenarkan untuk memakai tudung dengan seragam mereka, jika mereka mahu.
Saya harap keputusan ini akan diterima semua pihak  dengan semangat yang betul, dalam usaha untuk memperkukuh iltizam bersama kita bagi masyarakat berbilang kaum dan agama Singapura.  Terima Kasih.
I hope everyone will take this move on the tudung in the right spirit. We are making a careful adjustment to keep our racial and religious harmony in good order. This approach has worked well for us for many years and we should celebrate what it has achieved: a truly multiracial, multireligious nation, where many heart-warming interactions happen every single day.
For example, this friendship between Mr Mohammed Khairul and Mr Toh Ah Chye.  Mr Toh suffered a stroke two years ago. Recently, he needed help to get his COVID-19 vaccination. Khairul learnt about Mr Toh’s predicament, and volunteered to bring Mr Toh to the CC for his vaccination. Now, they have become good friends, and spend time together when Mr Toh goes to exercise at the Senior Activity Centre.
Another instance is this group of three neighbours - the Gohs, the Rajendrans, and the Tans. They have stayed together on the same corridor of their HDB block in Whampoa for many years. Before COVID-19, they held frequent potluck parties together. Now, they are helping one another through the pandemic. “Da baoing” food, watering each other’s plants or washing the lift lobby floor daily for everyone’s benefit. They are there for one another, in true high-rise kampong spirit.
Such positive stories seldom go viral. People of different races interacting daily at coffeeshops, in community centres, or on the sports field. People of different religions respecting one another’s beliefs, sharing spaces, worshipping in temples, mosques and churches all along the same street. People falling in love across racial and religious lines, getting married and setting up families. These things happen daily. They are the norm in Singapore, and they are precious. Long may that continue.
Tonight, I have talked at length about our society and people because Singapore is more than just a place to live, work and play. This is home, where we care for one another, where we are all equal and have our voices heard. Where we share a special bond with one another, where we all belong. As a country, we have many strengths to be proud of - our healthcare system, our civil service, our public infrastructure, our national reserves.
But our greatest strength is our people - united and resilient, steadfast and resourceful, in good times and bad. During COVID-19, we stepped up in so many ways to support one another, making hand sanitisers, sewing facemasks, delivering food to the quarantined, refurbishing laptops for disadvantaged kids, caring for migrant workers, vaccinating the elderly or showing a little extra kindness to one another, starting young.
In this moment of crisis, Singaporeans have continued to look ahead, and to pour heart and soul into our hopes and dreams.

Like Joan Poh. She is a nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. She is also a national rower. She has just returned from the Tokyo Olympics, where she represented Singapore for the first time. For years she trained hard, preparing for this once in a lifetime opportunity. But when COVID-19 hit, she heeded the call for medical reinforcements, and returned to work without hesitation. It compromised her training, but she never gave up her dream to be an Olympian. She said ""When I am at work, I am 100% a nurse; when I am at training, I am 100% a rower"". Joan, you represent the best of being Singaporean
In ordinary times, we may not realise how strong Singaporeans can be. Now, in the crisis of a generation, we have shown ourselves and the world what Singaporeans can do. Aarman, Samsiah, Meng Yu. Aisha, Roslina, Priyaa. Yvon, Ruzhael, and Joan. They are our everyday heroes, and they are us.
I thought of them, and the many other everyday heroes among us, at the National Day Show last weekend. Some were there with me at the Floating Platform. Many more were watching from homes across the island. I thought of what we have gone through in these last two years, what we have done together, what we hope to achieve for tomorrow’s Singapore. Our people, our unity, our shared dreams – they give meaning to our National Day.
Many others watching the Show must have been thinking and feeling the same as I did. When we sang Majulah Singapura, the MC didn’t remind us to do it silently. I couldn’t help myself singing out aloud, and I could hear everyone else singing too. At that moment, we knew what makes Singapore special.
COVID-19 will not be our last crisis. We will surely encounter more trials on the road ahead. We will be tested again, sometimes severely. Each generation will wonder, as their parents and grandparents did: Will we survive? Will Singapore prevail? Will Singaporeans stay together as one people? My answer: We have done it before. We will do it again
Majulah Singapura!
Thank you, and goodnight!

   singaporewebsite update april",7820,"In his National Day Rally speech, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the nation's response to COVID-19, emphasizing the resilience and cooperation of Singaporeans, which helped manage the pandemic effectively. He highlighted the successful vaccination program, with 80% of residents fully vaccinated, and the shift towards treating COVID-19 as an endemic disease, requiring ongoing vigilance and adaptation.

PM Lee outlined Singapore's economic recovery and future growth strategies, focusing on maintaining Singapore as a global business hub, attracting foreign investments, and supporting local enterprises. He announced significant investments by multinational corporations like Pfizer and BioNTech, and the expansion of local companies into global markets.

The speech also addressed social challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly the support for lower-wage workers. PM Lee detailed enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme and the expansion of the Progressive Wage Model to more sectors, aiming to improve the livelihoods of these workers.

On societal issues, PM Lee discussed the delicate balance of managing race and religion in Singapore's multicultural society. He proposed new legislation to strengthen racial harmony and addressed workplace discrimination, announcing legal measures to ensure fair employment practices.

PM Lee reaffirmed Singapore's commitment to openness and multiculturalism, urging both locals and foreigners to adapt and integrate to maintain social harmony. He concluded by reflecting on Singapore's strengths and resilience, calling for unity and collective effort to overcome future challenges."
2022,"
My fellow Singaporeans
Good evening.
We have come a long way in our fight against COVID-19. We are now learning to live with the virus. With each infection wave, we have managed the impact better. The latest, the Omicron BA.5 wave, is now subsiding.
In many other countries, when a wave happens, cases shoot up furiously and then crash down suddenly, like a roller coaster.  And when cases shoot up like that hospitals come under a lot of pressure. In Singapore, our waves grow as well as tail off more gradually. This suggests we have been effective in slowing down disease transmission. We have spread out the impact, and prevented our hospitals from being overwhelmed.
Thus far, we have had fewer than 1,600 COVID-19-related deaths. Every death is one too many. But if our mortality rates had been like other countries, we could easily have suffered 10,000 COVID-19 deaths, or more by now. Our collective efforts have saved many lives.
Key to our success has been the high level of trust in our society. In some countries, a precaution as simple and essential as mask wearing became a heated point of contention. But in Singapore, people worked with and not against one another. You trusted your Government. You patiently endured rounds of easing and tightening measures despite the inconvenience. The Government upheld your trust by being open and transparent. We spoke directly to you, shared information readily, and gave you the full facts even when things did not look good. Above all, there was trust amongst Singaporeans that we would each do the right thing and have each other’s back. You practised personal and social responsibility.  You took your vaccinations when your turn came, protecting yourself, plus everyone around you and society as a whole. You kept your masks on, especially indoors. You conscientiously washed your hands after coming home. You have also become experts at swabbing yourselves using ART kits – what used to be an unpleasant experience has now become a routine chore. And if two red lines appeared, you self-isolated to protect others. Everyone did our part to keep us all safe.
Many of you went out of your way to help others. For example Mdm Alice Chua, who is a retiree. She volunteered at vaccination centres in East Coast, and brought fellow seniors to their appointments. Because she spoke Malay and dialects, she also bridged language gaps, and could reassure and comfort the seniors during their jabs. Every bit counted in our national vaccination campaign! Or take Mdm Ruku d/o Pakirisamy, a Yishun resident. She noticed many elderly neighbours were afraid to go out during the pandemic, so they were getting listless and moody. To lift their spirits, she cooked and distributed meals for her neighbours. Sometimes curry, sometimes beehoon. A simple pack of hot meal brought many warm smiles. Or Mr Razali Puasa, who stays in Toa Payoh. The playground near his block is very popular with young kids. But he saw that everyone was afraid of COVID-19. So he decided to wipe down and disinfect the playground, to reassure families that it was clean and safe to let their kids play there – a simple gesture, which made all the difference to the community. I am very glad that Mdm Alice, Mdm Ruku, and Mr Razali can join us here tonight.
Amid the darkness of the pandemic, through these personal acts of kindness, courage and concern, the Singapore spirit shone brightly. It has made us collectively a better people and a more resilient society.In our national response, many went above and beyond their call of duty. Healthcare workers, through their care and professionalism ensured that the rest of us could carry on safely with our daily lives; public officers, especially those on the frontlines, carried out many demanding operations, often at short notice; private companies generously provided resources and industry know-how to tackle many problems; NGOs and community groups made special efforts to take care of those who needed more help; and countless individuals from all walks of life who joined in our whole-of-nation response. Your actions were critical in our fight against COVID-19 and the nation is grateful to all of you.
In recognition of your sacrifices and public spirit, the Government will present everyone who participated directly fighting COVID-19 during the pandemic – both individuals and teams –a special state award. We will call it the COVID-19 Resilience Medal. In addition, those who made exceptional contributions will receive existing state awards such as the Commendation Medal, the Public Service Medal, and the Public Administration Medal. You know them from our National Day awards list. We will add a special indication to the name and the insignia, to show that this time the medal was presented for service fighting COVID-19 – maybe on the ribbon for the medal we will add two red lines.We will announce the awards list at the end of the year, and hold the award ceremonies next year to thank everyone properly in person.
Meanwhile, we must be prepared to encounter more variants and waves, because COVID-19 will remain with us for quite some time. Our Safe Management Measures (SMMs) have protected us well throughout the pandemic. We have adapted them to the changing situation, and gradually eased them as things stabilised. Today, just two SMMs remain. You must wear masks indoors like you are doing unless you are on stage like me; and you must be vaccinated for higher-risk settings, such as F&B dining-in and large events.With our situation stabilising, we will reduce the mask requirements further to prevent people from getting tired. We will only require masks on public transport, where people are in prolonged close contact in a crowded space, and in healthcare settings, like clinics, hospitals, and residential and nursing homes, where there are vulnerable persons. Everywhere else, outdoors or indoors, masks will be optional. For schools in particular, we should not need masks in class. I know parents are a little bit worried, but I think there is no need to worry, we have assessed it, we think it is safe. The children do need to be able to see the facial expressions of their teachers and of each other. You have to learn to read faces. Is he angry? Is he happy? Did he say ‘ter’ or ‘the’? ‘Ker’ or ‘ger’? Otherwise you grow up with a blank space in your brain. It is crucial for their learning and development. But please do not take off your masks this very moment. Please wait for the detailed announcement from the MTF.
Beyond these adjustments to SMMs, we must learn the lessons from COVID-19. One day, the next pandemic will come. A new virus will emerge, more transmissible, more adaptable and more dangerous than COVID-19 and we must be ready for it.
The most important lesson is to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility, continue to nurture trust in our society, day in day out, during normal times, so that during the next crisis we can again draw upon a deep reservoir of trust to see us through, just like we have done during COVID-19.

Strategic Challenges
Even as we emerge from the pandemic, our external environment has become very troubled.US-China relations, which sets the tone for global affairs, are worsening. The two powers are divided over many issues – their rival ideologies and systems of government; China’s growing influence in the world; plus many specific problems, including trade disputes, cyber espionage, the South China Sea, Hong Kong; and most recently and worryingly, sharply escalating tensions over Taiwan. Yet the US and China need to work together on many pressing global issues, including climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Their tense relationship is making this almost impossible. This is bad news for the world. President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping recently held a long video call.  They agreed to meet in-person. But neither side expects relations to improve any time soon. Furthermore, we must all hope that there are no miscalculations or mishaps, which can make things much worse very quickly.
Apart from US-China tensions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also has profound implications for the world, and for Singapore. First, the invasion violates the UN Charter and fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is particularly important to Singapore. Our security, even our existence, relies on countries upholding these principles. We cannot legitimise Russia’s wrongful actions. Russia claims that what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine is justified by “historical"" errors and ""crazy"" decisions. If we accept this logic, what happens if one day others use this same argument against us? Second, the war has created deep hostility between Russia and other states, especially US and NATO countries. Relations have completely broken down and there are nuclear powers on both sides. It is hard to imagine any satisfactory end to the conflict. Third, the war in Ukraine affects security in the Asia-Pacific. It has complicated the already strained US-China relations, and also relations between China and America’s partners in Asia, like Australia and Japan. We can expect more geopolitical contestation in the Asia-Pacific. Some countries will choose a side. Others, like Singapore, will try our best to avoid being caught up in major power rivalry. Our region has enjoyed peace for so long that it is hard for us to imagine things being different. But look at how things have gone wrong in Europe, how suddenly and quickly. Can you be sure that things cannot go wrong like that in our region too? So we must get real, and we must get ourselves prepared psychologically.
What can we do about these external dangers? First, we must stand firm on fundamental principles of international law. Work with other countries to uphold a rules-based order. For example, by speaking up at the United Nations. Taking cover and keeping quiet will hurt us in the long term. Next, we must take National Service seriously, and keep the SAF and Home Team strong and credible. If we do not defend ourselves, no one is going to defend us on our behalf. Most importantly, we must stay one united people. Never allow ourselves to be divided – whether by race, religion, income, social differences, or place of birth. Stay alert against foreign actors who are looking out to exploit our vulnerabilities and to influence our people for their own interests. I talked about this in my Chinese speech. Do not believe that everything that you read online is true. If we are taken in and divided, we will stand no chance. But united, we can deal with any problems that come our way.
Economic Challenges
Besides strategic dangers, we also have to deal with economic issues. We have emerged strongly from the pandemic. Most sectors are steadily recovering, including hard-hit ones like tourism and aviation. But now the war in Ukraine has clouded our outlook, although we still expect positive growth this year.
Top of everyone’s minds is the cost of living. Even before the war, inflation was already becoming a problem because COVID-19 had disrupted supply chains and it had also caused developed countries, especially the US, to implement huge spending packages, stoking inflation which spread internationally. But the war has made things worse. Oil and gas supplies from Russia are getting disrupted. This is pushing up energy prices worldwide. That is why our electricity prices have gone up. Ukraine and Russia are also major grain exporters. The war has prevented most of their grain from being shipped out to world markets, and that is causing shortages and price spiking up  globally.
The Government is doing everything necessary to support Singaporeans, especially middle- and lower-income families. The support includes cash payouts, U-Save rebates, S&CC rebates, CDC vouchers, and MediSave top-ups and more. This financial (fiscal) year alone, a middle-income family with two young children, staying in a 4-room HDB flat, can expect an additional $2,200 in support. A lower-income family staying in a 3-room HDB flat, like the one I talked about in my Chinese speech just now, can expect even more, about $3,700. This will not cover fully every cost increase, but it will help lighten some of the burden on Singaporean households. If the situation worsens, we stand ready to do more. MAS has also tightened our exchange rate policy. The Singapore dollar has strengthened. It makes travelling overseas more affordable. At home, it makes imported goods cheaper, in Singdollar terms. But there is a limit to this because a stronger Singdollar also makes our exports more expensive, and we lose competitiveness against other countries. So we have to be very careful not to overdo things.
The basic reality is that international economic conditions have fundamentally changed. It is not just the pandemic or the war in Ukraine. The recent decades were an exceptional period. Globalisation was in full swing; international trade grew rapidly; China’s economy was growing exponentially, and exporting more and more goods at highly competitive prices all over the world – this brought down the cost of many products, and kept prices world-wide very stable. This era is now over. China’s growth and exports are slowing. Their costs are going up. Some countries have raised tariffs against each other, particularly between the US and China. Countries are also relooking at their supply chains to prioritise resilience and self-sufficiency. That means not buying from the cheapest. That means accepting higher costs. While companies are opting for “just-in-case” instead of “just-in-time” production, all these trends are raising costs and pushing up inflation everywhere, including in Singapore.
We do not have much influence over this global inflation picture. What is within our power is to make ourselves more productive and competitive, because then our workers can earn more, and more than make up for the higher prices of food, fuel and other imports. That way we can all become better off, in real terms.
This requires us to press on with economic upgrading and restructuring; redouble our transformation efforts; encourage workers to upgrade their skills at every opportunity; and indeed, that is exactly what we have been doing.
Besides prices rising, physical supplies are also being disrupted. You all know about Malaysia’s export ban on chickens. But it is not just Malaysia. Indonesia temporarily halted palm oil exports, when high cooking oil prices became a political issue. India also recently banned wheat exports, to keep domestic wheat prices down. Under pressure, faced with food shortages and rising prices, governments will put their domestic needs first so we must expect more arbitrary actions like these, which will impact us.
As a small and open economy, we are heavily dependent on imports, even of essential goods. But we are not helpless. For quite a while now, we have been actively diversifying our import sources – building up adequate stockpiles of food and medical essentials; investing in agri-tech to make local farms more efficient and productive; pushing ahead with our “30 by 30 Goal”, to be able to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally by 2030. And when COVID-19 came, we redoubled our efforts.
It costs money to make our supplies more resilient. Buying from diversified sources means we do not just buy from the cheapest, or the most convenient producer. Maintaining stockpiles requires space, and incurs costs - we have to air-condition your stocks – but we must think of it as paying for insurance.
Early in the pandemic, when we raised the DORSCON from Yellow to Orange, it triggered a small scramble. I was hosting my Chap Goh Mei dinner that evening. Suddenly every phone was buzzing. My guests were receiving and sharing pictures of empty supermarket shelves. Fortunately, it was before I stood up to speak. So when I made my speech, I told them: Do not worry, Chan Chun Sing is on it (he was then the MTI Minister). I had faith in him. I told them, I promise you: you won’t have to eat combat rations! Because in fact, we had enough stocks in warehouses and logistics centres. We were able to re-stock the supermarkets quickly, and restored confidence.
Therefore, this year when live chickens stopped arriving from Malaysia, we did not flap. We could draw on ample stocks of frozen chicken from Brazil, the US, and other places. We soon brought in more chilled chicken from Australia and Thailand, and now Indonesia. The chicken rice stalls are back in business again.
People take this for granted but actually a lot of work goes on behind the scenes. Nothing happens by itself. Not even in Singapore. It is only possible because we always plan forward, to give ourselves options and solutions during crises, and that is how we must continue to prepare ourselves for the future.

Even as we navigate through an uncertain and troubled world, we have to deal with domestic issues.
One of the delicate tasks of this government, of any government, is to update our laws and practices from time to time, to reflect evolving social values and norms. For example, at last year’s Rally, I announced that we would allow nurses in our public hospitals to wear tudung with their uniforms if they wished to do so. It was a decision many years in the making. A generation ago, the move was difficult to imagine, and would certainly have been extremely contentious. But we waited patiently for understanding and confidence to strengthen between our races and religions, and we finally moved only when we judged the time ripe, after preparing the ground, explaining carefully our reasons, and the scope of the change being made. I am very glad this cautious move has gone well, and Singaporeans have accepted it in the right spirit. But that is not the only sensitive issue we need to resolve. Another concerns the treatment of gay people in our society under the law.
By and large, Singapore is a traditional society, with conservative social values. We believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman, children should be born and raised within such families, the traditional family should form the basic building block of our society.
Most Singaporeans would like to keep our society like this. This is the Government’s position too. We have upheld and reinforced the importance of families through many national policies, and we will continue to do so.
However, like every human society, we also have gay people in our midst. They are our fellow Singaporeans. They are our colleagues, our friends, our family members. They too want to live their own lives, participate in our community, and contribute fully to Singapore. We need to find the right way to reconcile and accommodate both the traditional mores of our society, and the aspiration of gay Singaporeans to be respected and accepted.
A major issue for gay Singaporeans is Section 377A of the Penal Code, which makes sex between men a criminal offence. It was originally introduced in the 1930s by the British colonial government. It reflected moral attitudes and social norms that prevailed back then. But over the decades, homosexuality has become better understood, scientifically and medically. In many societies, including Singapore, gay people have become more accepted for who they are, instead of being shunned and stigmatised.
Many countries that used to have laws against sex between men have since repealed them. They include several Asian countries, but so far not Singapore.
Parliament last debated whether or not to repeal  Section 377A in 2007. MPs expressed strong views on both sides. I joined in the debate to advise restraint and caution. I acknowledged that what consenting adults do in private is their personal affair, and the Government should not intervene. But I pointed out that not everyone was equally accepting of homosexuality. Quite a few had considerable reservations, particularly within certain religious groups, including the Muslims, Catholics and many Protestant denominations. The Government decided then that we would leave s377A on our books, but not actively enforce it. We stopped short of repealing the law. It would have been too divisive to force the issue then. It was better for us to live with this untidy compromise, and it was a practical way to accommodate evolving societal attitudes and norms in Singapore. The compromise did not satisfy every group but by and large, it has enabled all of us to get along. And so, we have lived with this sensitive issue, without it monopolising our national agenda or dividing our society.
Now, 15 years later, attitudes have shifted appreciably. While we remain a broadly conservative society, gay people are now better accepted in Singapore, especially among younger Singaporeans. It is timely to ask ourselves again the fundamental question: should sex between men in private be a criminal offence?
Singaporeans still have differing views on whether homosexuality is right or wrong. But most people accept that a person’s sexual orientation and behaviour is a private and personal matter, and that sex between men should not be a criminal offence. Even among those who want to retain s377A, most do not want to see it actively enforced, and criminal penalties applied. From the national point of view, private sexual behaviour between consenting adults does not raise any law-and-order issue. There is no justification to prosecute people for it, nor to make it a crime.
Furthermore, we have seen several court challenges to s377A, seeking to declare the law unconstitutional. None have succeeded, so far. However, following the most recent judgement in the Court of Appeal, the Minister for Law and the Attorney General have advised that in a future court challenge, there is a significant risk of s377A being struck down, on the grounds that it breaches the Equal Protection provision in the Constitution. We have to take that advice seriously. It would be unwise to ignore the risk, and do nothing.
For these reasons, the Government will repeal s377A and decriminalise sex between men. I believe this is the right thing to do, and something that most Singaporeans will now accept. This will bring the law into line with current social mores, and I hope, provide some relief to gay Singaporeans.
But at the same time, most Singaporeans do not want the repeal to trigger a drastic shift in our societal norms across the board, including how we define marriage, what we teach children in schools, what is shown on free to air television and in cinemas, or what is generally acceptable conduct in public.
In our engagements and soundings over several months, this has come through very clearly. Among those with reservations, some feel strongly about s377A itself. But for most, their main worry is what they feel s377A stands for, and what they fear repealing it may quickly lead to. They also worry that this may encourage more aggressive and divisive activism on all sides. This is not only the concern of those with religious objections, but is shared by many non-religious people. Even many Singaporeans who support repeal want to maintain our current family and social norms.
The Government understands these concerns. We too do not want the repeal to trigger wholesale changes in our society. We will maintain our current family-oriented approach, and the prevailing norms and values of Singapore society.
Hence even as we repeal s377A, we will uphold and safeguard the institution of marriage. Under the law, only marriages between one man and one woman are recognised in Singapore. Many national policies rely upon this definition of marriage – including public housing, education, adoption rules, advertising standards, film classification. The Government has no intention of changing the definition of marriage, nor these policies.
However, as the law stands, this definition of marriage can be challenged on constitutional grounds in the courts, just like s377A has been challenged. This has indeed happened elsewhere. If one day such a challenge succeeds here, it could cause same sex marriages to become recognised in Singapore, and this would happen not because Parliament passed any such law, but as the result of a court judgement. Then, even if the majority of MPs opposed same sex marriage, Parliament may not be able to simply change the law to restore the status quo ante. Because to reverse the position, Parliament may have to amend the Constitution, and that would require a two-thirds majority.
I do not think that for Singapore, the courts are the right forum to decide such issues. Judges interpret and apply the law, that is what they are trained and appointed to do. To interpret the law, what does the law say; to apply the law, how does it work in this instance. But judges and courts have neither the expertise nor the mandate to settle political questions, nor to rule on social norms and values because these are fundamentally not legal problems, but political issues.
This has been wisely acknowledged by our courts in their judgments dealing with such cases. But even so, those seeking change may still try to force the pace through litigation, which is in its nature adversarial. It would highlight differences, inflame tensions and polarise society, and I am convinced, this would be bad for Singapore.
We will therefore protect the definition of marriage from being challenged constitutionally in the courts. The legal definition is contained in the Interpretation Act and the Women’s Charter. We have to amend the Constitution to protect it, and we will do so.
This will help us to repeal s377A in a controlled and carefully considered way. It will limit this change to what I believe most Singaporeans will accept, which is to decriminalise sexual relations between consenting men in private. But it will also keep what I believe most Singaporeans still want, and that is to retain the basic family structure of marriage between a man and a woman, within which we have and raise our children.
What we seek is a political accommodation, one that balances different legitimate views and aspirations among Singaporeans. For some, this will be too modest a step. For others, it will be a step taken only with great reluctance, even regret. But in a society where diverse groups have strongly held opposing views, everyone has to accept that no group can have things all their way. If one side pushes too hard, the other side will push back even harder. In some Western societies, not few, this has resulted in culture wars, contempt for opposing views – not just for their views but for the opposing people, cancel culture to brow beat and shut up opponents, and bitter feuds splitting society into warring tribes. There are some signs of similar things starting to happen here too. I say,  let us not go in this direction. All groups should exercise restraint, because that is the only way we can move forward as  one nation together.
There is much more to be said on this difficult subject. I am sure what I have said tonight will set off further reactions and discussions, and we will have a full debate when we bring the legislation to Parliament.
But tonight, I wanted to set out our broad approach on this issue. We have a stable and generally harmonious society, and we will work hard to keep things like this. I hope the new balance will enable Singapore to remain a tolerant and inclusive society for many years to come.
While we deal with sensitive issues like s377A, please remember that it is not the only subject on the national agenda, we have many other important matters to deal with.
The 4G team are gearing up for the next chapter of the Singapore story. Recently, DPM Lawrence Wong launched Forward Singapore. The conversation is to build consensus on the kind of Singapore we want to see. We want to meet the enduring aspirations of every Singaporean, including a good start in life, regardless of background; affordable housing and childcare when you get married; opportunities to upgrade yourself throughout your career; and a healthy and fulfilling retirement in your golden years. How can we achieve this, into the next generation? What specific goals should we set for ourselves? What do we need to do, what trade-offs do we have to make? How can we rally everyone to realise our shared vision? This is what the Forward Singapore conversation is about.
I hope that through this exercise, we will better appreciate some enduring imperatives for Singapore:
First, we must take pride in being Singaporeans, strengthen our national identity, and understand where our national interests lie. Our ethnic cultures and religious traditions are an important part of our identity, but first and foremost we are all Singaporeans together. There will always be external forces pulling us in different directions. Singaporeans are being exposed to all sorts of persuasion and propaganda, misinformation and agitation, not least on social media and messaging apps, more so in a world riven by rivalries and tensions, with countries coming under pressure to support one side or the other. We need a strong sense of national identity to hold us together, and give meaning to our nation building. We are Singaporeans, and that is why we will never stop working together to build a home that we are all proud of.
Second, we must stay open and connected to the world. Globalisation is on the wane, and countries are turning inwards and protectionist. But Singapore is still a global city. We cannot survive in any other way. It is impossible for us to grow or make everything we need ourselves. Nor can we consume everything we produce, whether computer chips or pharmaceuticals or petrochemicals. To make a living, we will always require foreign investments, overseas markets, and excellent transport and communications links with all parts of the world. The international tensions and uncertainties make our task harder but countries will still do business with one another; MNCs will still look for places to invest; the world will still need financial centres, and communication and transportation hubs. If we are nimble and enterprising, we will get our share of these and more.
Third, we must build a world-class talent pool in Singapore. We do our utmost to develop our own talent, and enable every Singaporean to reach their fullest potential. But when it comes to top talent, we can never have enough. This is an age where talent makes all the difference to a nation’s success. We need to focus on attracting and retaining top talent, in the same way we focus on attracting and retaining investments.
This is true not just of Singapore. Countries all over the world are making a special effort to court top international talents. Germany recently allowed skilled foreign professionals to live there even before they secure a job. Come first, look for a job later. The UK wants to attract the best and brightest at the beginning of their careers. It recently introduced a special visa for graduates from the top 50 universities in the world outside the UK. If you look through the list, it  includes NUS and NTU! In this global contest for talent, Singapore cannot afford to be creamed off, or left behind.
Singaporeans are rightly concerned about the impact of large numbers of non-residents living and working here. I talked about this last year. The Government is following up to tackle the problems, and ease these concerns. But while we manage the overall population of foreign professionals here, we must not stop seeking out top talent who can contribute to our Singapore Story.
Let me give you one example: the biomedical sciences. Like so many important projects in Singapore, the story started with Dr Goh Keng Swee. In the 1980s he saw the potential of biomedicine, and Dr Goh set up the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB). Not everyone was persuaded. Some called it Goh’s Second Folly (the first was Jurong Industrial Estate. That one succeeded and this one they called it his second folly. They were not convinced. But we started. In the 1990s, we decided to make a big push on biomedicine. Mr Philip Yeo became Chairman of the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB), which later we renamed A*STAR. We scoured top universities and research institutes for the best biomedical scientists, researchers, engineers. Philip went round the world to pitch to them personally. He persuaded some of the top names in their fields – he called them the whales – as well as younger rising stars. They were taken by our vision, and they moved here. They moved their labs here, they moved their students here. They moved their team here. They did good work here. The whales mentored our local talents, who were then still new to the field – Philip called our local talent guppies – we awarded scholarships to hundreds of guppies, to study biomedical sciences all the way to PhD. The guppies trained under the whales, with the goal that one day they themselves would grow into whales. So, we created an eco-system for the bio-medicine business, and started on a long journey to become a biomedical hub. Our early guppies have matured. Homegrown scientists are now doing cutting-edge R&D. Quite a few have become principal researchers, leading their own teams. Others have founded startups, to develop and commercialise their discoveries. Today, our biomedical sector is thriving. It employs 25,000 workers and contributes almost one fifth of our manufacturing GDP. We have also attracted major projects, including from Sanofi and BioNTech – these are leading firms for vaccine manufacturing facilities. BioNTech is the second half of Pfizer-BioNTech, the vaccines which many of us have taken for Covid-19. It is a German company. When I met Chancellor Merkel last year before she retired, she says, I hear BioNTech is going to Singapore. They take note. It is significant. It means something to them. It means a lot to us. During COVID-19, our researchers – both Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans – made significant contributions. They helped maintain the international GISAID database, which facilitates sharing of COVID-19 genomic data worldwide. They developed test kits and other diagnostics. They enabled us to understand international progress on vaccine development, tap into industry networks, and thus secure vaccines and therapeutics early for our people. That is why we had the know-how, we had the confidence, we were prepared to take bets. We placed bets early and our bets paid off. We were able to vaccinate Singaporeans months before we would otherwise have been able to, saving time, saving lives, making a huge difference to Singapore. Had we not sought out top talent 30 years ago, then continued to build up our biomedical research teams and activities, and develop home grown talent, all this would never have happened. This is the difference that top talent can make.
We have a window of opportunity now. All the dark clouds around us have a silver lining. At such times, our trusted Singapore brand of quality, reliability and efficiency, our reputation gives us a competitive edge. And our track record tackling COVID-19 makes us stand out even more. Singapore has attracted the interest of many talented people and international companies. Those with special talents and skills are looking for places to move to, where they and their families feel safe and welcome, and where they can make an impact. Businesses want to invest in places where the talent is, business follows the talent, and they also look for places where the politics and policies are stable, and where the system works. That is why even during the pandemic, EDB continued to bring in many good projects, and even now we have a very strong investment pipeline of potential projects whom we have good chance of getting.We must seize this opportunity, to secure Singapore’s place in the post-COVID-19 world. We already have schemes to attract and retain top talent, especially in the technology industry (IT). But we need to do more, especially in the sectors with good potential. We want to make top talent everywhere sit up, pay attention, and think seriously about coming to Singapore. MOM, MTI and the economic agencies will soon announce new initiatives to achieve this. If we can get the people we want to come here, it will really help Singapore to shine brightly as a hub of innovation, entrepreneurship, and growth. It will make our own talent want to stay in Singapore, to participate in building a dynamic and outstanding nation, and every Singaporean will benefit from our progress and success.
We are Singaporeans, and that is why we will never stop working together to build a home that we are all proud of.PM Lee Hsien Loong

Our seaport and airport play a critical role putting us on the global stage. They connect us to the world, and keep Singapore a thriving business and trading hub. That is why we have always taken the long view, and continuously improve our sea- and air-ports.
Ten years ago, I spoke about our plans for Tuas Port, and Changi Terminal 5. We have been working hard at these plans. Tonight, I want to give you an update.
Let me take our seaport first. It serves not just Singapore, but many countries around us. A decade ago, Asia was growing strongly, and we anticipated that PSA’s business would grow with it. The existing terminals at Tanjong Pagar, Brani, Keppel and Pasir Panjang were working fine. But we decided nevertheless to consolidate all our port operations into one mega port at Tuas. This shift would progressively free up prime waterfront land from Shenton Way to Pasir Panjang for the future Greater Southern Waterfront.
The move to Tuas has already started. If you drive past the Tanjong Pagar terminal on the AYE, you can see  it is no longer used for container operations. It is almost empty. That is why, during the pandemic, we could put up isolation and recovery facilities for COVID-19 patients in the container yard.
Tuas Port is now up and running. The first two berths started operations last December, ships are calling there from all over the world. Because we had planned ahead, our port was able to handle extra volumes during the pandemic. While ports in other countries experienced closures, severe congestion and long delays, but PSA, our port remained open 24/7 throughout. This reinforced Singapore’s position as the “catch-up port” where vessels made up time for delays elsewhere. In fact, last year, Singapore handled a record high of 37.5 million TEUs of containers. We kept our position as the world’s busiest transhipment hub.
In the process of moving to Tuas, we modernised and upgraded our port operations. The new port is automated and digitalised. It uses AI to coordinate operations more seamlessly, including vessel traffic management and port clearance. Instead of trucks with drivers, it deploys a fleet of driverless AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles). These other things here. There are no drivers. It just moves around magically by itself. This smooth transition owes much to our port workers, unions, PSA and MPA, the Maritime and Port Authority. Management and unions worked hand-in-glove to retrain workers and help them adapt to new working environment. On their part, workers picked up new skills, upgraded themselves, and became more productive.
We have just completed Phase I of Tuas Port; Phases II, III and IV will follow. When fully completed around 20 years from now, Tuas Port will handle 65 million TEUs annually – almost double today’s volumes. We will have the world’s largest fully automated port, and that should make us a leading global player in the maritime space.
In the same way, Changi Airport secures Singapore’s position as a global aviation hub. We have ambitious plans for Changi too. Over the years, we have progressively expanded and upgraded it. I previously spoke about Terminal 4 and Jewel, they are now done. But even before we broke ground for Terminal 4 and Jewel, we already envisaged building Terminal 5. Let me show you on a map. Here are T1 to T4. And this is T5 –T1, 2, 3, and 4. T5 is as big as all of these put together. In terms of capacity, T5 will have 50 million passengers , which is equal to T1 plus T3. But if you look at the way the airport is built, all the new part of the airport, T5 and all these new half, in fact, we are building one more new Changi Airport. It is huge. Next to T5 we will develop the Changi East Urban District. This will be a new business and lifestyle destination, creating more jobs and opportunities for Singaporeans. Before the pandemic, we were about to call a tender to build T5. Due to COVID-19, we paused our plans for two years, but we made good use of the down time. We reassessed the long-term prospects for air travel and improved the terminal design. We concluded that the future of aviation remains bright. Now, with borders re-opening, people are travelling again. Passenger traffic has already exceeded half of pre-COVID-19 levels. In the longer term, air travel will keep growing because of a fast-expanding middle class in our region. Hence we decided to go ahead and restart the T5 project, we redesigned T5 to be more resilient. In particular, to operate more safely and flexibly during a pandemic – to scale operations up and down more easily, and to isolate passengers from different flights to limit cross infection. We also made T5 greener and more energy-efficient. When completed in the mid-2030s, T5 will show the world what sort of place Singapore is. Let me give you a preview of the passenger arrival experience – from arriving, to the skytrain, to immigration, to baggage collection, to a beautiful Singapore welcome! And once you leave the terminal, you can go down the escalators, and take the MRT straight into town. T5 will be a place that all Singaporeans can take pride in and enjoy.
Our decisions to press on with Changi T5 and Tuas Port send a strong and clear signal to the world that Singapore is emerging stronger from the pandemic, and charging full steam ahead.
Changi and Tuas are specific examples of how we plan our economic infrastructure.
But I am sure you also want to know how we can live, work and play in the future.
Over the last year, URA has been working on the Long-Term Plan Review, which we used to call the Concept Plan. This is not just to prepare for the next 5 or 10 years, but to rethink what Singapore can look like in the next 50 years and beyond. The Plan takes in feedback and ideas from the public, and guides our future development.
I visited the exhibition at the URA Centre last month. It includes an eye-catching display of artwork. URA had held a competition for primary and secondary school students to imagine Singapore of the future. The many creative drawings show how our young visualise Singapore will be when they grow up. Let me show you two pieces.
This is “Today’s Future” by Salma Ma. It won the first prize in the Primary School category. Her drawing shows downtown Singapore – skyscrapers with rooftop gardens, all connected by an underwater MRT system! You see here, with headlights. I hope we do not have to submerge our MRT lines into our rivers and seas, but Salma’s piece highlights real considerations in urban planning, including dealing with rising sea levels, and having sufficient green and blue spaces in the city.
This next piece is “Floating Home” by Justin Teo, who won in the Secondary School category. His idea is to levitate houses, places of interest, infrastructure, and transportation, and build a city in space. We might not quite have the technology today, but Justin’s piece captures the boundless optimism and “can-do” spirit that we seek in preparing for the future.
And it is not just Salma and Justin. There are over 200 impressive pieces by the students are on display. They showcase the talent and imagination of our young. Just looking at their drawings made me feel young again!
Some of these art pieces may be too futuristic for us to implement now, but they inspire us to think out of the box, and URA planners work hard to translate big dreams into workable plans.
For example, I have told you before thatPaya Lebar Airbasewould move out, and that we would redevelop Paya Lebar. The relocation will start in the 2030s, but URA is already engaging the public and industry partners to explore redevelopment concepts.
Let me share some of the ideas. This is Paya Lebar Airbase . The runway is a dominant feature. It stretches from one end to the other, 3.8 km long. It is aligned along the direction of prevailing winds, for aircraft to avoid crosswinds when aircrafts take off and land. The future town can be oriented this way too, parallel to the runway and then the town naturally breezy. Hopefully, residents will not need to turn on their air conditioning quite as much. We can repurpose the runway into the town’s central spine, turn it into a green connector or community space extending from one end of town to the other. It will be a distinctive and attractive heritage feature, unique to Paya Lebar. On both sides of the spine, we will build public and private housing. MND estimates we can build around 150,000 new homes, which is roughly what we have in Punggol plus Sengkang today. There will be amenities and recreational areas close by, as well as commercial and industrial developments, to bring jobs closer to our homes. It is not just about using the land physically occupied by the airbase. Once the airbase moves out, we can also lift some of the building height restrictions around it, e.g., in Hougang, Marine Parade or Punggol. This means we can redevelop these towns, include more amenities, and make much better use of the space there. It will not happen overnight. But over decades, we can completely reimagine the Eastern part of Singapore.
Singaporeans sometimes worry that we will run out of space in future. That housing will not be available or affordable. I say: No need to worry. We have done our studies and planning. We will have enough space for future generations. Our problem is not finding the space to build enough flats, nor keeping home affordable for Singaporeans. We know how to do that. Our problem is having enough babies to grow up and live in them! And I do not know how to do that but we will come back to that subject in a future rally.
Our island may be small, but it holds great potential. Paya Lebar is just one example of how we are reimagining and transforming Singapore. We are doing this all across the island – Jurong Lake District, Greater Southern Waterfront, and many other areas too. Each new estate will be more liveable, greener, and more sustainable than the previous one. This is not easy to do, but just as past generations planned for and created the Singapore that we live in today, we too, must never stop imagining and building the future Singapore for the next generation and beyond.
I have touched on several challenges this evening.
Whether we are tackling COVID-19 and preparing for the next pandemic, dealing with geopolitical dangers and economic uncertainties, handling sensitive domestic issues, or planning and building Singapore for the long term.
With all these challenges, success depends on us getting three key master fundamentals right. We must always have a united people, a high-quality leadership team, and high trust between the people and their leaders. A united people, a high-quality leadership team, and high trust between the people and their leaders. These are essential if we are to respond creatively and resiliently to challenges, year after year. We may have the best laid schemes, but without these three fundamentals, they will come to nothing. I have emphasised these points over and over again, in different ways, because they are so crucial.
In particular, good leadership is non-negotiable. Look at the countries where governments are unstable and politics messy, swinging wildly from one election to another. Whenever things do not work, leaders are forced out, or resign en-masse. But even after changing teams, things fail to improve. Policies and laws either never make it through the political gridlock or they are made by one government and then reversed by the next. Often, it is not just the leaders who disappoint, but the whole system that has failed. The result is a devastating loss of faith: not just in individual politicians or parties, but in the whole political system and the whole political class, and there is no way forward from there.
A small country like Singapore has zero margin for error. Not just Singapore’s continued success, but our very survival, depends on us having the right leaders. Leaders with integrity, dedication, and competence; leaders with the conviction to make the tough calls and do the right thing, even when it may cost them some votes; leaders whom you can trust. We cannot afford any compromise on this.
Thankfully, for 57 years, over three generations, we have had leaders who have earned and maintained Singaporeans’ trust and confidence, who have worked closely with the people to deliver on sound policies, who have improved all our lives.
Never take this trust, nor this competence, for granted. Keep on working hard to find the right people, get them to serve, and help them to do their best for Singapore. It is our duty to extend our success formula into the next generation and beyond.
Leadership succession is therefore of paramount importance. When COVID-19 hit us, I had to put my succession plans on hold. Now we are learning to live with COVID-19, and entering a new normal. The younger ministers have chosen DPM Lawrence Wong to be their leader. I am very happy that the matter is settled, and my succession plans are moving forward again. I am also glad that from everything I see, Singaporeans are supportive of Lawrence and his leadership of the team. So I ask you to give Lawrence and his 4G team – your team – your fullest support.
The next few decades will be bracing but exhilarating. I have given you my take of what we can achieve, and also what may go wrong. But with your trust, we can come through whatever difficulties await. With your support, we can turn hopes and dreams into reality, and united as one people, we can secure a brighter future in this uncertain world. Not just for now, not just for ourselves, but for every Singaporean child, for many generations to come.
Thank you and good night!

   singaporewebsite update april",8657,"In his speech, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed the nation's response to COVID-19, emphasizing the effective management of infection waves and the high level of societal trust that contributed to fewer than 1,600 related deaths. He highlighted the collective efforts in adhering to safety measures and the proactive role of community members in supporting each other during the pandemic.

PM Lee announced the introduction of the COVID-19 Resilience Medal to honor those who significantly contributed to the pandemic response. He also discussed the gradual easing of Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including making masks optional in most settings while maintaining them in crowded and high-risk areas.

Looking beyond the pandemic, PM Lee stressed the importance of learning from the experience to prepare for future health crises. He underscored the need to maintain the spirit of personal and social responsibility and to continue building trust within the community.

The speech also touched on broader strategic and economic challenges, including escalating US-China tensions and the impact of Russia’s actions in Ukraine on global and regional security. Economically, Singapore faces inflationary pressures exacerbated by global events, but the government is committed to supporting citizens, particularly through subsidies and financial aids.

PM Lee reassured the public about Singapore's long-term planning, including infrastructure projects like Tuas Port and Changi Terminal 5, which signal the country's readiness for post-pandemic recovery and future growth. He also reiterated the importance of maintaining a stable society, respecting diverse views, and continuing to foster a united national identity amidst global uncertainties."
2023,"
My fellow Singaporeans, good evening.
We are all relieved that COVID is behind us. Life as we knew it has resumed.
COVID-19 was the most challenging ordeal for our nation since Independence. We can all be proud of how we pulled through together. Unlike many other countries, Singapore has emerged from the pandemic stronger, more resilient, and more united. This is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of our nation.
Having come through COVID, we are once again being tested. The international environment is fraught with geopolitical tension and economic uncertainty.
We feel acutely the pressures mounting all around us. The rivalry between the US and China affects every country and region in the world. Their mutual wariness and distrust has deepened. The rest of the world has to tread a careful path, to avoid being caught in the cross-fire. The war in Europe rages on. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a continuing human tragedy, and an assault on international norms and values. It is a cautionary warning to the rest of the world never to take peace for granted, and a reminder to us of the vital importance of a strong SAF. Meanwhile, the global economic order is fraying. Globalisation is weakening. Supply chains are splitting up. Countries are layering on multiple protectionist measures. This hurts all countries, but especially small, open trading nations like ourselves. With global warming, the world is also experiencing more extreme weather. From China to Japan, to Europe and the US, no region is spared from floods and droughts, heatwaves and wildfires. This will affect food production and prices worldwide. We have not fully felt it in Singapore yet, but it is coming.
Economically, Singapore is keeping up. We expect positive economic growth this year. Hopefully, we will avoid a recession. Inflation is at last coming down, but it will probably stay higher than what we were used to. The cost of living is still on everyone’s minds. In my Chinese speech earlier, I explained how the Government will continue to support you. We will weather this storm together.
Our nation must navigate carefully in this increasingly troubled landscape. There is no ready playbook, there is no model answer. I am glad that DPM Lawrence Wong and the 4G team have taken it upon themselves to chart out where Singapore will go from here. They launched Forward Singapore in June last year, to refresh our social compact. They have held dialogues with thousands of Singaporeans who shared their ideas to tackle various issues. For example: how to equip our people with the skills to succeed; how to improve care for the vulnerable; and how to strengthen our solidarity as one people. The Forward Singapore report will be published later this year. It will be a compass to help Singapore navigate through the stormy seas.
Despite the dark clouds, the world still offers many opportunities for those who dare to seize them. In my Malay speech just now, I spoke about promising new sectors such as the digital economy. I also shared that the Government will give more support to workers – to help you adapt and upskill, to stay ahead of the game. Our Forward SG plans include financial support for workers who lose your jobs, while you upgrade your skills. It will be a temporary safety net to help you meet immediate needs, to free you to upskill and train, as you prepare yourself for a good long-term job. So long as you are willing to make the effort, the Government will go the extra mile to help you.
Financial concerns are top-of-mind not just for younger workers, but also the older ones. These concerns become more urgent as we approach retirement.
Especially for those in their 50s and early 60s. Let us call them the “Young Seniors”. ""Young”, because you are younger than the Pioneer Generation and the Merdeka Generation; “Seniors”, because you will soon retire, or maybe you have recently retired.
Young Seniors are in a unique position today. Compared to the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations, you have benefited more from Singapore’s growth, and generally done better in life. But compared to workers younger than you, in their 30s and 40s today, you have generally earned less over your lifetimes. You have also had less time to benefit from improvements to the CPF system, and so have built up less retirement savings. Young Seniors are also in a particularly sandwiched phase of your lives. You have to shoulder the responsibility of caring for both the young and old in your families. Your kids may be young adults, but often are not yet fully independent and still live in the same household. Many of you Young Seniors also have elderly parents at home, who may be beset with the infirmities of old age. You have to shuttle them to medical appointments and hospital visits, plus attend to their everyday needs. All this, while watching your own health, because you are not so youthful yourselves. Responsibilities on all these fronts multiply your burdens. So, as Young Seniors, you are understandably anxious about your retirement needs. Beyond the daily cost of living pressures, you know that retirement is creeping up on you. You wonder: Will I have enough to get by? Can I cope? But do not worry – the Government will help you. You will not be left behind.
We will introduce a package to help Young Seniors meet your retirement needs – let us name it the Majulah Package. This will be for Singaporeans who are 50 and above this year – born in 1973 or earlier. It will benefit those with lower incomes and less wealth. The support will be tiered, depending on your income and your CPF savings. The Majulah Package will comprise three components.
First, an “Earn and Save” Bonus, to help you build up your CPF savings while you work. Most Young Seniors are still working, and have some years to go before retirement. We encourage you to continue working as long as you can. Lower- and middle-income workers will get a CPF bonus of up to $1,000 a year, depending on your income. The Government will credit this into your CPF account, on top of the usual employer and employee contributions. You will receive this Earn and Save bonus yearly, as long as you are working, whether full-time or part-time. Take for example a lower-income 55 year-old who plans to retire at 65. Over 10 years, her Earn and Save bonus adds up to $12,000 in extra CPF savings if you include the CPF interest, which is not bad.
Second, a Retirement Savings Bonus (RSB). If your CPF balances have not reached the CPF Basic Retirement Sum, you will receive a one-time CPF bonus of up to $1,500. Those who are not working will get this bonus too. This includes homemakers, who have given up their careers and laboured to raise their families, and thus have very low CPF balances.
Third, a MediSave Bonus. Most Young Seniors have enough MediSave balances. Nevertheless, many still worry about healthcare costs, because you will soon be Not-So-Young Seniors. So the Majulah Package will include a modest one-time MediSave Bonus of up to $1,000. It will give you some extra buffer, to help pay your medical expenses and insurance premiums.
The Majulah Package will help Young Seniors, in their 50s and early 60s, to meet your retirement needs. But besides Young Seniors, we also want to encourage older seniors to continue working for as long as you can. Hence the Majulah Package also covers the Pioneer and Merdeka Generations.
I think quite a few here belong to the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation. Let me say to you, if you are PG and MG: If you are still working and meet the income criteria, you too will receive the Earn and Save Bonus as long as you are working. If you are not working, you can still get something from the one-time Retirement Savings Bonus and MediSave Bonus. This will be in addition to the PG or MG benefits that you are already receiving and will continue to receive. Think of this as a 58th National Day present!
The Majulah Package will cost the Government about $7 billion. MOF will create a new Fund to meet the full lifetime costs of the Package, using resources from this term of Government. We will honour this commitment without burdening future generations.
The Majulah Package will benefit some 1.4 million older people across several generations. We will also be enhancing existing schemes, like Silver Support, Workfare, and the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and the details will be announced next year. Taken together, these improvements will help seniors to meet basic retirement needs, especially for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans so that you can have greater peace of mind in your golden years.
I want to talk about two other important issues tonight – caring for our ageing population, and housing our people.
Singapore is one of the fastest-ageing nations in the world. Today, about one in five Singaporeans is a senior, aged 65 and above. By 2030, nearly one in four Singaporeans will be a senior. I first talked about ageing in the National Day Rally back in 2007. At that time, we had 500 centenarians – people aged 100 and older. We thought that was a lot. By 2013, which is 6 years later, this had doubled to around 1,000. And by 2030, we are likely to double again to at least 2,000 centenarians! It shows vividly how our society is getting older and older, faster and faster. Today, if you ask – it is not in the chart – but we have about 1,500 already. In 2030, I will not be making this speech, but whoever is doing so will have to take care of all of us seniors, and some of us very senior.
Today, we are an aged society; soon, we will be a ‘super-aged’ society. This has massive social and economic implications. We have much to do to help our seniors age well.
Today, I will speak on two aspects of our preparations: active ageing; and making homes and precincts more senior-friendly.
First, on active ageing.
We have invested significantly in healthcare for seniors.
The Government plays a big role in providing care, but seniors must also play our part to look after ourselves. MOH launched Healthier SG last month. Healthier SG aims to get each of us to take more responsibility for our own health, supported by family doctors and community partners. When you enrol, you will get a personalised health plan, including when to go for screenings and vaccinations. Besides medical prescriptions, your doctor will also give you what we call social prescriptions, like advising you to lead a more active lifestyle, to maintain a healthier diet, to lose a little bit of weight, or to quit smoking. But while your GP can suggest or even arrange these for you, only you can decide to follow through and do them. But please do so. Prevention is always better than cure. My wife and I have signed up. I encourage all seniors to sign up for Healthier SG when you get the invitation from MOH.
Beyond Healthier SG, how else can we help Singaporeans to age well? It is not just about fending off sickness – it is also about staying well, staying well both physically and mentally. Because mental wellness is just as important as physical wellness. One of the biggest threats to the well-being of seniors is loneliness. Today, many seniors are living alone. They risk becoming socially isolated. Their spouses may have passed on; their children are probably living elsewhere with their own families. So it is important that someone keeps regularly in touch with them. It is also important that they keep active and have a social network for mutual support. During COVID, many old folks were stuck at home, unable to go out for their usual activities. We were very worried that isolated and inactive, they would deteriorate quickly. So we restarted community activities for seniors as soon as we could do so safely – stand further apart, do it outdoors, but gather and do it, and keep that human contact, and that activity.
We will do more to help seniors stay engaged and socially active. That is why we have set up Active Ageing Centres (AACs) all over Singapore. I recently visited this Active Ageing Centre, the Bedok Radiance AAC. It is run by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities. I was very happy to see a vibrant community of seniors joining the activities and using the services there. Many of them told me that they were living alone, and always looked forward to coming down to the activities. It gave them something to do with their friends, something to look forward to, a sense of purpose.
The AAC ran a varied weekly programme: art jamming, karaoke and dance classes. When I was there, a HAPPY exercise class was in full swing – HAPPY means Healthy Ageing Promotion Programmes for You, H-A-P-P-Y.
The seniors looked happy, but some of them were not so well. A few were wheelchair-bound, but they still joined in the activities. This cheerful lady told me she hoped to joget again! Why not, even in a wheelchair? Other seniors were using the health services at the AAC. Some were getting their vital signs checked so that doctors could follow up if something was amiss. One was having a teleconsultation – with nurses physically there to help him, and a doctor calling in on Zoom from the polyclinic. It was good that relatives, or neighbours, were making the effort to bring the seniors down to the AAC, for them to socialise and cheer up their lives.
What I found most encouraging was that many seniors were not just taking part in activities, but also helping to organise and run them – seniors for seniors. I met Mdm Goh, the one in the pink blouse, Mdm Karen, and Mdm Farida. They were preparing to deliver hot meals to frail seniors living in upstairs in the rental flats who could not come down to the AAC. They do this every day. It is a great way to build neighbourly bonds while staying active. Actually, besides meal deliveries, there are also communal meals downstairs at the AAC. The staff told me that these meals were a big draw and an important activity because they encourage the old folks to come down. When they gathered at the AACs for meals, they would socialise and make friends, and the staff could keep an eye on them, made sure they were alright. I also discovered that these meals are actually cooked by the seniors themselves, at least some of the seniors themselves! These three makciks – Mdm Aminah on the left, Mdm Rosnah, and Mdm Fatimah – they used their SkillsFuture credits to attend a food hygiene and preparation course so that they could cook meals for their fellow seniors. Mdm Fatimah told me they use less salt and sugar in their cooking to make it a Healthier Choice. Then I tasted her chicken curry, and I said, ""You must have used santan – coconut milk.” She said no – she uses normal milk. But it tasted just as good – sedap sekali! I had a second helping.
If you are observant, you would have noticed that the volunteers I have mentioned are all ladies. But we are starting to see more male seniors coming down to the AACs. The centres are introducing more activities that interest men, such as jamming. Or even something simple like a café corner, where the uncles can catch up over a coffee. There will be something for everybody at the AACs.
I was very heartened by my visit to Bedok Radiance AAC. I believe that the network of AACs across Singapore will be a valuable resource for seniors to stay active and healthy. We will invest to expand the network, and work with community partners to enhance the AACs’ services and reach.
If you have elderly family members, especially if they are living on their own, please bring them to join an AAC nearby. And if you are a senior yourself, I strongly encourage you to join a centre near you, because many seniors are having a good time there. Take the first step towards active ageing, so you can live well, and age well. Be like Mdm Wong here. This is Mdm Wong, she is 97 – still going strong, still playing Mahjong! Making HDB Homes and Precincts More Senior-Friendly.
Besides encouraging active ageing, we will also make our HDB homes and precincts more senior-friendly. Many seniors have told us that they want to live out their golden years in their own homes and neighbourhoods. It is a familiar environment, a cosy sanctuary, and they have established deep roots and meaningful friendships. This is a very good thing. We will help as many seniors to age in place as we can. We need to make a few moves to realise this.
First, we will make your homes more senior-friendly. Today, under the EASE programme (Enhancement for Active Seniors), you  can install fittings like ramps to help you get in and out of your homes. In toilets, you can install grab bars and make the floors slip-resistant for safety. Soon, seniors can choose from an expanded suite of fittings under EASE 2.0. For example, you can have foldable shower seats, you can have your toilet entrances widened, so that if you or your spouse needs a wheelchair, your wheelchair can be brought into the toilet, and life can be safer and much more convenient.
Secondly, we will make it safer and more comfortable for seniors to move about their neighbourhoods. For example: we will revamp streets and linkways frequented by seniors; we will build more shelters and rest points; also more therapeutic gardens, fitness trails, and exercise machines, to encourage seniors to stay active. The roads will be made more pedestrian-friendly. For example, longer green man signals to give seniors more time to cross the road. You see down here, 36 seconds – the motorcycles and cars have to wait, does not matter, old folks’ safety is important. This is their home, their area, we put them first. Barrier-free ramps and raised zebra crossings so that wheelchair users can cross over without having a step to go down and a step to come back up again at the curb; 3D road markings and narrowed roads to slow the cars down. We will also install larger and more colourful block signs, with familiar symbols to help seniors remember their own block and find their way home. This is not where the satay stall is – it is the Satay Block, Block 113 in Kebun Bahru.
Third, for those who need a little more help, we will build more assisted living facilities. Take for example IDeAL – the Integrated Dementia Assisted Living project at Block 115. At the Kueh Lapis Block, Block 115 in Kebun Baru. I went to open it last year. It is a ground-up project by Dementia Singapore, with some Government support, to help seniors with mild dementia. Many of the seniors live in their own flats in this block. The void deck has become their community living room, where seniors have fun and games, exercise, get their haircuts, and eat together. Whenever a senior needs anything, he or she will go to the second floor. The residents affectionately call this “Ji Lao” – the Second Floor. There are shared facilities there like a community kitchen, where they cook and hang out, and a telehealth room, where staff can monitor their vital signs and arrange for telemedicine checkups. All at Ji Lao! At IDeAL, seniors with dementia can live happily on their own upstairs, and enjoy the warmth and care of friends and community downstairs. HDB is building similar assisted living projects called Community Care Apartments. They will serve not just seniors suffering from dementia, but also those who are well. We will need a whole range of these facilities – whether for assisted living, or the AACs – to serve old folks with different needs. Some of these already exist today. But we need to improve them, scale them up, and get ready for the large numbers down the road.
We will keep making Singapore a more friendly home for current and future seniors: investing resources to senior-proof your homes; making precincts safer and easier to navigate; and constructing more assisted living residences, with integrated accommodation, care, and community facilities. We will do this across Singapore, starting with the towns with the most seniors like Ang Mo Kio and Bukit Merah.
So we are taking major steps to prepare for a super-aged society. It is part of a new national programme called “Age Well SG”, which will complement Healthier SG in improving the health of our seniors. The Ministries will share more about this in the coming months.
Together, we will make Singapore an endearing home for all ages, where seniors can age with dignity and grace, connected with friends and family.
Now I want to speak about public housing. HDB is a vital part of the Singapore story. Right from the very start, the PAP Government put heavy emphasis on public housing. Here is Mr Lee Kuan Yew laying the foundation stone at the Cantonment Road Housing Estate in March 1963. This was HDB’s earliest projects, one of them. Mr Lee was convinced that housing would give Singaporeans a stake in our nation’s future. Because, he explained, housing “gives more than a sensation of permanence; it is permanent…then we dig our toes in and we fight!” So, housing has always meant much more to us than a roof over our heads. It also gives every Singaporean a valuable asset and a powerful reason to fight for our country and our future. Fast forward 60 years, today we have one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. Nine in ten Singaporeans own our homes. Eight in ten live in HDB flats. Our Singaporean identity is deeply intertwined with our HDB flats and towns. These are homes we are proud to own, neighbourhoods we raise our families in, and communities we build together.
Over the decades, the Government has kept housing affordable and accessible for Singaporeans. We price HDB flats at a substantial discount below their market value. We also provide a wide range of generous grants to first-timers, families, and the lower-income.
COVID disrupted our public housing programme. BTO projects were delayed. The shortfall of new flats pushed up prices of resale flats. MND and HDB have been working very hard to catch up. They are making good progress. So far, HDB has completed and delivered more than 70% of the flats that had been delayed by the pandemic. We are also ramping up supply. We have launched 50,000 flats since 2021. By 2025, in two years’ time, we will have launched another 50,000 flats, making a total of 100,000 flats. With supply catching up, the market is calming down. First-timer BTO application rates are lower. Waiting times are shorter. Resale prices are gradually stabilising.
Recently, MND announced changes to help Singaporeans with urgent housing needs get their flats earlier. Families with young children and young married couples buying their first home will receive more ballot chances, and higher priority in flat allocation. HDB will also launch more BTO flats with shorter waiting times of two to three years. We are working extra hard, and I am confident that we will get over this hump soon.
Tonight, I want to look beyond this hump, to the longer-term public housing landscape.
Since the early 90s, HDB has used a simple framework to guide the public in buying flats. We distinguish between Mature Estates and Non-Mature Estates. Mature Estates are places like Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh, or Queenstown. This is a picture of Dawson, in Queenstown, where I recorded my National Day Message this year. Mature Estates are usually more centrally located, better connected, and with more amenities. Naturally these places are more popular, and their prices reflect the higher demand. Then there are the Non-Mature Estates: These are less central and further out, like Jurong East, Woodlands, and Punggol. What Non-Mature Estates lose in terms of location and convenience initially, they make up for in lower BTO prices. Between Mature and Non-Mature Estates, HDB has been able to offer a flat for every household’s budget. This framework is easy to understand, and has worked well for many years.
But our housing landscape is evolving. Firstly, we have fewer and fewer large tracts of undeveloped land left to build new towns and estates. Tengah will be the last new town for quite some time, at least until Paya Lebar Air Base moves out to Changi and the site is cleared and redeveloped. Increasingly, we will have to build new HDB flats within or near to existing estates. These will often be more centrally located. For example, at Mount Pleasant, where the Police Academy used to be, we are planning to build 5,000 new homes there. New projects like these – nestled in older, more developed areas with a lot more amenities – will be more popular, and will naturally cost more. Secondly, even what we call “Non-Mature Estates” today have become much more developed. We imagine non-mature estates as being very barebones. Blocks of flats surrounded by empty barren ground. Our mental image is this photo, and once upon a time it looked like this – this was Toa Payoh in the 1960s. Toa Payoh does not look like this today. But look around you now. Towns like Jurong East, Woodlands, or Punggol, that is not barebones. These towns have matured, and now have excellent connectivity and a full suite of amenities, so the distinction between Mature and Non-Mature Estates is blurring. This is reflected in BTO applications. Some choicer projects in Non-Mature Estates are even more popular than projects in Mature Estates. It shows that buyers are discerning – you know when you see a good deal, and what matters to you are the specific attributes of the project, rather than whether we call it Mature or Non-Mature.
In future, many more BTO developments will be in estates or locations that are effectively “mature”. That means that the framework of Mature and Non-Mature Estates will no longer work and we need a new framework. This framework has to achieve three important objectives: One, it has to keep home ownership affordable to all income groups. Two, it has to maintain a good social mix in every town and every region. And three, it has to keep the system fair for everyone. And here is how we will do it.
For a start, we will keep HDB flat prices affordable. We will gradually provide more housing grants, especially grants that are means-tested, like the Enhanced Housing Grant. This way, lower- and middle-income households will get the most support to own their homes. There will always be an HDB flat to meet every budget. And we can maintain a good social mix in every town and region.
This will work for most HDB projects, but it will still leave one particular problem and that is, with projects in choicer locations within a region. For example, projects near an MRT station or near the town centre. Such flats see the highest demand during BTO exercises. People know that HDB is offering a good deal, because these flats will fetch much higher resale prices afterwards. This turns the BTO exercise into a lottery. Those who are lucky enough to ballot such a flat stand to reap a windfall upon resale. This will not be fair to the many more who miss out.
Take for example one recent BTO project: Central Weave at Ang Mo Kio. This is Ang Mo Kio; let me zoom in, Central Weave is right at the town centre. Let me zoom in a little bit more. It is next to the MRT and bus interchange. The market is there, the hawker centre is there, Ang Mo Kio Hub is nearby. So location, location, location. This is an excellent location; this is a highly desirable project. HDB’s selling price had to reflect these attributes. So, the prices for the biggest flats at Central Weave – the 5-Room and 3-Gen flats – ranged from $713,000 to $877,000, before grants. Even then, these flats were heavily discounted off their true market value. Some people complained that these prices were exorbitant and unaffordable. Yet these units were heavily oversubscribed. More than 6,500 households applied for just 372 such flats – 17 applicants for every flat! Clearly, these applicants must have found the Central Weave project affordable, and thought that the prices offered them good value. And no doubt many hoped their flats would fetch strong resale prices later on.
So think about it. If you were HDB CEO sitting down, confronted with this problem, what will you do? You have a dilemma, a dilemma with projects at choicer locations like Central Weave: should we price them higher, or lower? If we price them higher, we will shrink the windfall gains, reduce the lottery effect. This will moderate demand and that is good. But there will be sticker shock – these flats will become expensive and unaffordable to most families. And we will not get a good social mix. Some people will still afford them, but mainly those near the income ceiling, or those whose parents can help them pay for the flat. The result: the precinct will become a higher-income enclave, and that is not what we want. But if HDB prices such prices lower, more households can afford them; we achieve a better social mix, that is good, but we exacerbate the lottery effect, because the potential windfall will be even richer. Even more families will try for these flats. For every one happy successful buyer, there will be 20 or more unsuccessful buyers, and they will understandably and justifiably frustrated and very unhappy. And this is not fair. So under the present framework, whether we price such flats higher or lower, we cannot fully achieve all three objectives: affordability, a good social mix, and a fair outcome.
So what do we do? Central Weave is already sold, but we can expect more such situations as we build more flats in existing towns.
How do we solve this problem?
Our solution is to introduce a new “Plus” model for selling HDB flats at choicer locations, with stricter sale conditions so that we can moderate the prices. Let me explain carefully what I mean.
Today, HDB launches BTO projects all over Singapore. We are all familiar with them. Everybody knows the BTO rules. For example, a 5-year Minimum Occupation Period, or MOP, after which the owner can resell the flat. There is no income ceiling for resale buyers. These are the standard rules and apply to what I will call “Standard” projects. In future, most HDB projects will still be Standard projects.
But within each region, some HDB projects will be in choicer locations. Take for example, Bayshore, in Bedok. This is Bedok town. Bayshore is there, let me zoom in. And you can see, Bayshore is a very good location for homes, because you have got two MRT stations, Bedok South and Bayshore MRT stations. Shopping malls will be built in this corner, Siglap CC is there. East Coast Park is across the road, and then you have the waterfront, 有山有水.
We will have both private and public housing in Bayshore. The HDB projects will likely be Plus projects and will be sold under different rules. HDB will give more subsidies for these Plus flats, over and above the subsidies for Standard BTO flats. This will moderate the prices of Plus flats and put them within reach of more households. But to make the scheme fair, HDB will also impose more restrictive sale conditions. For example: A longer MOP of 10 years, to favour buyers who are planning to stay there for the longer term, and discourage those who may be thinking of flipping the property and moving out as soon as they can. Tighter restrictions when the home-owner resells the Plus flat later on, such as a subsidy recovery applied on the resale price, certain percentage when you sell the flat, you pay back a certain percentage back to HDB to take back the extra discounts you enjoyed upfront since you are moving out. This is to be fair to other buyers who did not get these Plus flats. Also there will be an income ceiling on resale buyers, just like how we have an income ceiling on first-time buyers. This will moderate resale prices and help to maintain a better social mix, even in the resale market in the longer term.
As we build more projects in mature areas, this Plus model will help us to meet our three objectives: affordability, good social mix, and fairness. I keep on showing you this slide because this is crucial. These are the three fundamental objectives and we must bear that in mind, when we think about what is HDB doing, why is HDB doing this, how does doing this help us to achieve these objectives? It will help Singaporeans find a house that suits your needs, even in good locations. Not just for you, but for your children too.
Actually, the Plus model is not entirely new; we already have something similar, called the Prime Location Public Housing Model. Let us call them Prime projects for short. One example is Bukit Merah Ridge. Like other Prime projects, it is very close to the city centre. Naturally, these flats are very desirable, and will be more expensive. But we have been able to keep their selling prices reasonable by imposing tight restrictions and a subsidy recovery to moderate the windfall gains. The Prime model has shown good outcomes so far. In Bukit Merah Ridge. The selling price for a four-room flat ranged from $540,000 to $737,000, before grants. Each flat attracted 5.4 applicants – far fewer than Central Weave, even if you compare to the four-room flats in Central Weave. And we hope that Plus projects will achieve similarly good outcomes. So, let me go back to Central Weave because you are probably thinking and asking: had we sold Central Weave as a Plus project, with the tighter restrictions and additional subsidies, would HDB have priced it lower than it actually did? The answer is yes, it would, because that is the whole point of Plus projects: to enable HDB to moderate the prices of flats in choicer locations, and still be fair to all flat buyers.
So think of it like this. Standard flats are good flats built all over Singapore, and will have HDB’s standard subsidies and standard restrictions. Plus flats are in the choicer locations within a region, and will have more subsidies and tighter restrictions than Standard flats. And Prime flats are in the choicest and most central locations in the whole of Singapore, and they will have the most subsidies and tightest restrictions. Let me show you the whole picture in one slide.
The new framework of Standard, Plus, and Prime. Standard islandwide, subsidies are standard and restrictions are standard – that is why we called it standard. Plus flats have choicer region, more subsidies and tighter restrictions. Prime flats, have the choicest locations, most subsidies and tightest restrictions. Actually the quality of the flats, they are all good flats, good flats, good flats. But the locations are different, the subsidies are different and the restrictions are different. And this new framework – Standard, Plus and Prime will be a major change to the way HDB sells flats. HDB will roll out this framework for all new projects from the second half of next year. It will not affect existing projects. Your current homes, or the homes you have already booked, will not be reclassified.
In time to come, we will no longer refer to new projects as Mature and Non-Mature. Instead, we will build a good mix of projects within and across regions, to cater to different needs and budgets. And that is how we can fulfil our commitment to keep high-quality HDB flats accessible and affordable to you and your children for a very long time to come.
The new framework – Standard, Plus, and Prime – will affect everyone buying a new HDB flat, but there is one special group I want to address: the singles. More and more Singaporeans are choosing to be single. Singles too hope to own their homes and have more housing choices. We hear your concerns.
Today, first-timer singles can apply for new flats, but only 2-room Flexi flats and only in Non-Mature Estates. They cannot buy new Flexi flats in Mature Estates. Singles are also not allowed to buy Prime flats. These rules are to prioritise our limited supply of flats, but unfortunately, they have restricted singles’ choices. We will do something about this.
When we roll out the new framework, singles will be allowed to buy 2-room Flexi flats across all types of BTO projects – Standard, Plus, and Prime. HDB will tell you the details soon. But I am sure singles will welcome this move to have more choices to find your own home and to write your own part in Singapore’s housing story.
I spoke earlier about the foundation stone that Mr Lee laid back in 1963. Today, Cantonment Road Housing Estate has been redeveloped into our most iconic public housing project – The Pinnacle @ Duxton. But 60 years on, that original foundation stone is still there, at the Heritage Garden at the Pinnacle. It occupies pride of place, to remind each new generation that our housing programme is a vital part of the Singapore story; that the Singapore we live in today, is what we have inherited from those who came before us; and that we owe an immense debt to the hard work and good governance of the founding fathers and the pioneer generation.
In a few weeks’ time, we will be marking the 100th birth anniversary of Mr Lee Kuan Yew. It is timely to reflect upon the values and ideals championed by Mr Lee and the founding fathers., and for us to renew our commitment to these enduring values and ideals.
I spoke in my Malay speech earlier about an exhibition now on at the National Museum: Semangat yang Baru: Forging a New Singapore Spirit. The exhibition tells the story of the birth of our nation. It transports us back to our early years of nation-building. It honours the indomitable spirit of the Pioneer Generation. They dared; they fought ferociously for Singapore; they never gave up. And thus they turned mudflats into a metropolis, and took us from Third World to First.
But our forefathers built more than a nation of bricks and mortar, skyscrapers and a thriving economy. They created a nation founded on ideals: justice and equality; religious freedom and racial harmony; a commitment to excellence; a fair system of meritocracy; and an uncompromising insistence on honest, clean government.
Integrity and incorruptibility are fundamental to Singapore. They are the foundation on which we run a clean and effective Government, and deliver results for Singaporeans. Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered these the most crucial ideals of all. On his 90th birthday, he came to Parliament to attend the sitting. We celebrated his birthday in the Members’ Room. We were all there – PAP MPs and Ministers, Opposition MPs led by Mr Low Thia Khiang, as well as NMPs. Frail and ill, Mr Lee said just a few words. He spoke only about one thing – he reminded us Singapore must always remain clean and incorruptible, and Ministers and MPs have to set the example. Otherwise, he said, we are finished. I will never forget those brief words. For the sake of the country, I will do all I can to keep faith with Mr Lee’s hope. No matter the price; no matter the embarrassment or political cost – I will do my utmost to keep the system clean. Every generation of PAP leaders must also stand by this – this is what Singapore depends upon.
The ideals I spoke about are not just abstract aspirations. They are our compass; they guide every decision we make. They give purpose and meaning to our nation building. They make Singapore stand tall amongst the nations of the world.
By upholding these ideals, we have over decades built a high trust society. One where people trust one another – “regardless of race, language or religion”. Where the people and the Government trust each other too, in big ways and small. This is what saw us through the ups and downs over the past 58 years, and this is how we weathered COVID-19.
COVID now seems like a bad dream. Confused, receding, getting forgotten. But the pandemic could well have been a real nightmare. Things could easily have gone horribly wrong, as they did in many other countries. Thankfully, we avoided disastrous outcomes, and averted the loss of many, many lives. Our people came through safe and sound; our economy revived in good shape; and our society has grown more united, not less. We owe this to our collective efforts, and our strong mutual trust, which we must strengthen and deepen to secure a bright future for our people.
As we prepare for the future, one crucial task is leadership renewal. As you all know, my original plan was to hand over and step down as Prime Minister by 2022, before my 70th birthday. But the pandemic disrupted this plan. I promised Singaporeans that I would see the nation through the crisis, together with both the current and the 4G leadership. Now COVID is behind us, and my succession plans are back on track.
Recently, several controversial issues have drawn Singaporeans’ attention. I have spoken about them in Parliament, and in my National Day Message. We dealt with each of them thoroughly and transparently. Let me assure you: these incidents will not delay my timetable for renewal. We are on track.
More and more, my task is to support the 4G team and their agenda. I want to get them off to the best start possible. They are increasingly setting the pace. My themes in this Rally are all Forward SG themes. The 4G will soon wrap up the Forward SG exercise, but their journey is just beginning. Our nation’s future depends on them, working as one with you to take Singapore forward.
I have every confidence in Lawrence Wong and his team. We share the same core convictions – that we are stewards of Singapore, entrusted with the immense responsibility to lead and care for our nation; that our time as stewards is transient, but we are building a Singapore for the ages; and that our best service to this nation is to hand over a better, stronger Singapore to those who follow us. My team and I are deeply grateful to you for standing with us through thick and thin. Please give Lawrence and his team your fullest support too, now and after they take over.
The Singapore story has been an unlikely one from the start. Our nation is still young, and we will always be tiny. We will forever be an unlikely nation, created out of the sheer collective will of our people. Nobody expected us to survive, much less to flourish. But each time, we beat the odds; each time, we showed the world what Singapore can be.
It has been an exceptional story; but I believe the best parts are still to be written. Let us hold fast to: our values, which anchor us and guide our way; our mutual trust, which is the bedrock of our success; and our dreams, which drive us ever forward. Let us come together with a renewed spirit and vigour, a semangat yang baru, to build a better, brighter Singapore for generations to come. Majulah Singapura!

   singaporewebsite update april",7427,"In his speech, the Prime Minister of Singapore addressed the nation's recovery from COVID-19, emphasizing the resilience and unity that have strengthened the country. He highlighted the ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties affecting the global landscape, including the US-China rivalry and the war in Ukraine, which underscore the importance of maintaining a strong Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).

The Prime Minister discussed the economic challenges posed by protectionism, disrupted supply chains, and global warming, which are expected to impact food production and prices. Despite these challenges, Singapore anticipates positive economic growth and is taking measures to manage inflation and the cost of living.

A significant portion of the speech was dedicated to the ""Forward Singapore"" initiative, launched to refresh the social compact and address various societal issues through extensive dialogues with citizens. This initiative aims to equip Singaporeans with necessary skills, improve care for the vulnerable, and strengthen national solidarity.

The government is also introducing the ""Majulah Package"" to support ""Young Seniors"" (Singaporeans in their 50s and early 60s) with retirement needs, offering financial bonuses to enhance CPF savings and provide healthcare support.

Additionally, the Prime Minister outlined plans to make public housing more accessible and affordable, with a new framework to manage housing in choicer locations through a ""Plus"" model, ensuring fairness and social mix while maintaining affordability.

The speech also touched on the need for Singapore to adapt to an aging population, with initiatives to promote active aging and enhance the living environments for seniors.

Overall, the Prime Minister's speech reaffirmed the government's commitment to navigating Singapore through current global challenges, supporting its citizens economically and socially, and preparing for future demographic shifts."
